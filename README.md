## Deployment Instructions

Start by cloning this repository into your `/var/www/` folder:

    git clone 

Create a `config/secrets.yml` file structured as follows:

    development:
      secret_key_base: {secret}
      json_api_token: {secret}

    test:
      secret_key_base: {secret}
      json_api_token: {secret}

    production:
      secret_key_base: {secret}
      devise_secret_key: {secret}
      json_api_token: {secret}

In the place of each `{secret}` place a unique secret generated by `rake secret`.

Create a tmp folder in your project root:

    mkdir tmp

Run the project migrations, ensuring first that you have configured your `config/database.yml` file:

    bundle exec rake db:migrate

If you're deploying to production the migration command is:

    RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migration

Also for production you will need to precompile the assets:

    RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
