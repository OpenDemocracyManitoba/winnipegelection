One of the significant future directions for the Board will centre around the School Board Leadership Initiative, \"Setting Clear Expectations for Student Learning\" launched in 2009. This project included consultation and extensive dialogue with the community and divisional staff. I am running for re-election to continue my work on this and other initiatives that will positively impact student learning in our division and to continue to serve the community within Ward 1.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nMy four years as school trustee and currently, Vice Chair of the Board has provided me with a thorough background and knowledge of the crucial issues in education. I believe our division must be ready to respond to today’s needs of students and teachers, providing the resources necessary for successful learning, all the while, being fiscally responsible to the community. As a trustee, my role has involved serving on key divisional committees including Finance and Education. I have also represented Pembina Trails at numerous school events from Parent Council meetings to student assemblies. This experience coupled with my background as an educator continues to make me a strong advocate for public education.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nI believe we must be ready to respond to the many needs of the 21st Century student and provide the resources needed for successful learning. Among my priorities are:\n\n1. Literacy \n2. The Creative Arts\n3. English as an Additional Language\n4. Technology in the classroom \n5. Student academic achievement\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nThe schools in Pembina Trails School Division are exemplary. The division has a very positive reputation not only within the community but throughout the province for support of student learning and innovative programming such as recently launched Edu-Tube program, in partnership with the Manitoba government, Frontier School Division and industry partners. My particular interest in Ward 1, the area I represent, is to encourage young families to move into Charleswood, \"The Suburb Beautiful\", to get the benefits of a exceptional educational system.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nIn 2009, I was elected Vice Chair of the Board and also sit on the Board of Winnipeg Technical College. Prior to being elected to this position, I completed my teaching career of over 30 years, teaching at Dieppe, Royal and Van Walleghem schools in our division. My training and experience focused on Special Education, literacy, French Immersion, and Early Years. I also served as President of the Assiniboine South and Pembina Trails Teachers' Associations. As a resident of Charleswood for over 20 years, my involvement in the community has varied from serving as Chair of the Winnipeg Public Library Board to Past President of the Friends of the Assiniboine Park Conservatory. I was a founding Director of the Assiniboine Park Conservancy, co-chair of the annual \"Books and Brunch\" event as well as being a member of organizations such as the Charleswood Horticultural Society","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":14,"electoral_race_id":3,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.472-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.472-05:00"},{"id":14,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nWe have embarked on a Board Leadership Initiative, to extend dialogue and consultation with all of our community and educational stakeholders. I have taken an active role in setting the vision for this initiative and would like to continue to serve in this capacity as we move towards implementation and continued dialogue to establish collaborative partnerships within the education community.\n\nI am running for re-election in order that I can support our objectives to raise academic standards such as literacy and numeracy skills and increased student engagement and achievement. I will continue to support the practice of empowering administrators and teachers to be innovative and creative so as to build capacity for increased student achievement.  I will also continue to support enhanced professional development opportunities which will give staff the skills and strategies to actively engage learners with varied learning styles/multiple intelligences.  Employing practical strategies based on data and evidence will identify needs and develop strategies to improve outcomes.\n\nBy running for re-election I will promote meaningful accountability and continue to work collaboratively with our school communities and parents in a transparent and honest manner.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI have had the privilege of representing the Charleswood Ward 1 as a School Trustee for the past 17 years. Within this time frame, I also represented the Assiniboine South School Division and Pembina Trails School Division, as a member of the Governing Board at Winnipeg Technical College from 1999-2006 where I was Chair of the Board for 3 consecutive years (2001-2004) and Vice Chair in 2003. On standing committees I chaired Finance, Education, Buildings Property and Transportation, and Negotiations with Teaching and non-Teaching Staff.\n\nI was a member of the Community Legal Education Association of Manitoba Board of Directors (1994-2006) and served as its President from 1998-2000. Nationally, I was selected as a member of the National Advisory Group ‘Moving Forward with Articulation Agreements in Canada’. As well, I am an individual member of the Canadian Comprehensive Audit Foundation (CCAF) which is dedicated to meaningful accountability and effective governance, management and audit.\n\n These experiences demonstrate my commitment to build on my capacity to govern and proven leadership abilities. I have a demonstrated ability to utilize critical pathways to establish collaborative partnerships within the education community. \n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nAs the learning environment/climate becomes more complex Boards/Senior and School Administrators and Management must act together to optimize value for your money.\n\nTrustees must possess a vision of relevance in order that our high school students leave with current skills. Crafting a draft budget that envisions expanding educational opportunities for our students and seeing that the Division is managed efficiently\n is an on going process each and every year.  \n\nThe interests of students are paramount!  I believe in long term Tax Stabilization and making balanced decisions based on evidence and facts after considering the alternatives.  My view would be increasing public school taxes would be a last resort after having explored other methods of meeting financial objectives. We must be consistent with providing a quality education within budget.\n\nWe will be continuing to create and maintain safe and caring learning communities.  This includes enhanced Workplace, Health and Safety and Security Strategies.\n\nPresently, we have the fastest, most powerful fibre-optic educational network in Canada, delivering state of the art technological supports to students in 33 schools. As an issue, we need to assure and enable the division to continue to be cutting edge and innovative in its endeavours. \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nWe must continue to build on the process and protocols associated with public consultation. The Division must endeavour to honour the wishes of its individual school communities. In this way, a relationship of trust and open communication can be established and honoured. Board directives should not be changed arbitrarily without the consent of the Board of Trustees. Trustees must remember whose interests they represent- the electorate.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nMy wife Myra, my family and I have resided in Charleswood for the past 31 years and have been actively involved in community and school affairs. My children James and Kristin attended K-12 in the Pembina Trails School Division and are graduates of Oak Park High School. My oldest grandson is currently attending a Pembina Trails School in Grade One and my youngest grandson is anxiously awaiting to enroll in ‘Kindergarten Here We Come’ next year. \n\nCurrently I am curling in the Masters League at Charleswood Curling Club on Tuesday mornings. In the late 1980’s and early 1990’s my son, my daughter and I curled in the Parent/Junior League also at Charleswood Curling Club. \n\nAs a past educator, I am enthusiastic about providing expanded educational opportunities and technological supports for our students. I have dedicated my career to providing students with extracurricular activities and programs and received a Manitoba High School Athletic Association 2010 Lifetime Achievement Award for Coaching as well as a Sport Manitoba Coaching Excellence Award (2006) for years of service. \n\nIn September 2010 I was an active participant at the University of Manitoba Bison Basketball Reunion for teams spanning 1955-1976.","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":15,"electoral_race_id":3,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.485-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.485-05:00"},{"id":15,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nOne of the reasons I decided to run in the 2010 school board election is because our division is at an important stage in the process of moving forward with a leadership initiative of setting clear expectations for student learning.  This involves the areas of student learning in literacy and numeracy, and student engagement.  Having been involved in this important initiative for nearly two years I am anxious to contribute to the next steps of implementation and communication within the learning communities of our Division. \n\nAnother reason is the continuing passion I have for working to ensure students are well educated and prepared for their future in today’s world.  I believe that the education of our youth is the most important task to which I can devote my time and energy.  As a trustee it has been evident that the multitude of decisions made by the school board affects the learning environment for students and staff.  I’m prepared to collaborate with parents, staff and the community to make sure those decisions continue to be positive for Pembina Trails School Division.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nThe experience I bring to the role of being a school trustee consists of nearly 24 years of serving in this capacity.  I have held all positions including chair of the board, chair and/or member of all standing committees, and have served on countless special committees. In addition I’m a past chair of the governing Board of Winnipeg Technical College.  I’m a past president of the Manitoba School Boards Association where I experienced the opportunity of learning about the direction, achievements and needs of education throughout Manitoba and Canada.  \n\nI spent 16 years as an employee of the Manitoba Government implementing educational programs for families as an extension home economist with 10 of those years in management as a provincial program director.  Since then I’ve been a self employed facilitator and consultant focusing on strategic planning, policy and program development.  Last year I completed the coordinators role of 'Poverty is Hazardous to Women’s Health' project for the Women’s Health Clinic.  \n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\n* Being fiscally responsible by making sure our financial resources is spent wisely by balancing educational and student needs with the dollars available;\n* Learning can only take place if our school environments are safe and caring places to work and learn.  All partners including parents, schools and community need to cooperate to ensure this important aspect; \n* Engaging students in their learning and meeting their diverse needs is complex today for several reasons.  Most students have known technology since their birth, many come from other countries without either English or French language, and others live in poverty and come to school hungry, as examples;\n* Ensuring student academic success by providing classroom support for curriculum implementation, access to new technologies and staff development are essential; The educational leadership initiative of the Board to increase literacy and numeracy outcomes for student learning and to enhance student engagement requires continued use of divisional assessment data, discussion and analysis with all involved. \n* Improving our buildings with up dates to classrooms, libraries, music rooms, science labs, etc. are necessary including regular maintenance, ensuring safety codes are met and creating inviting learning spaces for students. \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nStrengthening communication with our communities is an area I’d like to see improved.  Today everyone is so busy it is difficult to reach the public with information about what’s happening in their neighbourhood schools.  As more community members do not have children in school I think it is important that we increase the understanding of public education in today’s world and find ways to involve more people in our schools.  So many exciting and positive initiatives take place every day in schools and generally other than the parents, the community knows little about these endeavors.  Many community members would be interested to see how schools use technology in classrooms, what a science lab looks like today, experience how accomplished the students are in music, the arts, etc.  Quality, comprehensive education is expensive and taxpayers should have more opportunities to understand how those dollars are being used and to celebrate student success.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI have resided in Charleswood since 1974 and together with husband Lyle, raised our daughters in this great community.  Both of our daughters were in the French Immersion program.  Jody began at Dieppe school for kindergarten and then as did   Lori, attended Royal School, Charleswood School and both graduated from Oak Park High School.  As parents we are grateful for the outstanding education they received in the school division and are proud as they contribute to our community as young adults.  Jody is the Director of educational programs at Fort Whyte Alive while Lori and husband Robert own and operate Kick It Dance studio.\n\nI have served on many local, provincial and national boards and committees.  Presently I am the treasurer of the Canadian Home Economics Foundation, and a co chair of Taking Charge Inc.  Previously I’ve been a council member of the Agriculture Research and Development Initiative and of Eco Action, and am a past president of the Charleswood Business Women’s Curling Club and Royal School Parent Council.

I want to continue to work towards shaping the policies of the division, setting the future direction of the board, and to ensure that students and their teachers have adequate resources to meet their needs.  I personally believe that the education of our children is the most important contribution I can make to my community.\n\nI have a proven record of collaboration with parents, staff and all community members and will ensure the decisions of the Board continue to support educational excellence through challenging and enriching experiences for all children. \n\nAs a parent of 2 daughters and 2 sons who currently attend schools in Pembina Trails School Division I share the experiences and concerns of parents in the Division. \n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI was first elected as Trustee for Ward 2 - Pembina Trails School Division in 2006.\n\nAs a School Trustee, I have worked with others for a better system of education, and have been active on the following committees, including: \n\n* Governing Board Member - Winnipeg Technical College\n* Committee Chair: Buildings, Property and Transportation Committee, Pembina Trails School Division Educational Support Fund, and Communications and Community Relations Committee\n* Member: Finance Committee, Human Resources and Policy Committee, Teachers Negotiation Committee, Van Walleghem Student Transportation and Traffic Flow Committee, and Fort Garry Community Network Liaison \n\nOther accomplishments include;\n\n* Past President, Fort Garry Community Centre\n* Bachelof of Commerce Degree (Honours)\n* Program Manager with Manitoba Hydro for 23 years\n* Outstanding Citizen’s Award for leadership in the community - Winnipeg 2003\n* Presidents Award for outstanding leadership in the community - Fort Garry 2005.\n\nAs an advocate for the community for the past 10 years I know that our Ward is comprised of community members who have varied levels of interest in education. I understand the importance of finding creative solutions to expand programming opportunities at our schools, while holding the line on taxation. \n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nThe traditional curriculum that consists of separate “core” subjects, with a few added options, is not sufficient to prepare students for the future. The Board must remain committed to finding creative solutions that get the best value for our education expenses while continuing to deliver the best in: technology; fine arts; practical arts; technical vocational opportunities; physical education; and languages. The Board must continue to support a more holistic education that provides students with the learning experiences and knowledge they need to develop their potential while in school, in order to assume their roles as productive citizens entering the post-secondary world of education and the work force.\n\nThe Board will be challenged to effectively address many issues over the next years, including: maintaining safe school environments; teacher salary negotiations; adequate funding for education in the context of the current economy; the success of the provincial immigration policy and the impact on public schools; and ensuring students are engaged in learning. \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nThe Trustee role and the decisions of the school board impact communities, families and the learning environment for all students. Pembina Trails School Division is at an important stage in our School Board Leadership Initiative; the extended dialogue and consultative process with our communities and with our staff. The leadership initiative has led to the Board setting clear expectations for student learning in literacy, numeracy, student engagement, and achievement. Having been involved in this important initiative for the past two years I want to continue to contribute to the next steps of implementation and communication with our school communities in the Division and in my Ward.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nPembina Trails School Division has become the school division that exemplifies the provincial expectations for education and has a great reputation for student learning, use of technology in the classroom, and the development of innovative programming. The recently launched Edu-Tube program is just one example of innovative programming in the Division. \n\nOver the past four years I have remained committed to working on behalf of the communities I represent, to bring community voice to the table, to make sure Pembina Trails School Division is meeting the educational needs of our children and community. There has been advancement in educational programming while holding the line on taxation. \n\nProgramming has not suffered. The Division continues to focus on the “core” subject requirements and is continually looking at creative ways to expand educational opportunities.\n\nWe have had significant growth in school-based day cares, with new ones flourishing in Linden Meadows, Whyte Ridge, Viscount Alexander, and Oakenwald Schools.\n\nOpportunities for technical vocational programming are expanding and we are making greater use of technology in the classroom.\n\nInnovative teaching tools developed by Pembina Trails allow students and teachers to participate in real-time tutoring sessions utilizing intranet/internet based services","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":18,"electoral_race_id":4,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.542-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.542-05:00"},{"id":18,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nI really enjoy this work and believe I have the knowledge and experience to continue to serve my community well. I am excited to continue shaping the Divisions direction through policy and governance.   We are in the midst of an exciting leadership initiative, Setting Clear Expectations for Student Learning. We have just completed a year of consultation with the community and employees.  I would love to continue to contribute to the direction of this and other initiatives on behalf of the communities I serve and the entire Division. \n\nMy husband and I have three children, two of whom are in Pembina Trails schools while the oldest has graduated and is now at the University of Manitoba.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI have served the community for the past 12 years as a school trustee.  \n\nMy experience includes: \n\n* Chair (2003 to 2005) \u0026 Vice-Chair (2001 to 2003), Pembina Trails School Board\n* Chair (2006 to 2007) \u0026 Vice-Chair (2005 to 2006), Winnipeg Technical College Governing Board\n* Board Committee positions have included: Education, Public Relations, Human Resources \u0026 Policy, Buildings, Property \u0026 Transportation, Finance, various Staff Contract Negotiation committees\n* Provincial Trustee representative for various Manitoba School Boards Association committees\n\nI have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Agriculture from the University of Manitoba and worked in Western Canada and Europe in various sales and marketing positions.  I am currently employed at the U of M Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences as their Community Liaison Coordinator.\n\nI have gained significant budgeting, planning, negotiation and teamwork skills through my professional and volunteer work over the past 25 years. I have served on numerous community and church boards, and have held a variety of positions in volunteer organizations. Most recently, I served on the board of the Linden Woods Community Club and in 2008 was the Director of the School Program for the Tim Hortons Brier, with over 6000 students participating.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\n* Education funding will continue to be an issue as schools are responsible for much more than basic education.  Appropriate funding needs to follow this increased mandate for public education.  We need to ensure that we are able to continue to offer a high quality education so all children can reach their potential.\n\n* Effective use of your tax dollars through multi-year budget planning based on realistic projections. \n\n* There is an increase in students in the division where English or French is not their first language and supports need to be provided to help these students be successful.  The Division has supports in place but the ever-changing demographics means this needs to be closely monitored.\n\n* There is a changing culture in society with respect to quick access to information and social networking.  That offers us both challenges and opportunities to engage students in the classroom with technology.  \n\n* The Board needs to continue to work on communicating with our community in a meaningful way in order to try and engage them in public education conversations.  This includes parent councils and employees but also the large majority of taxpayers that have no children in the education system.\n\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nAs I mentioned above, I would like to see us continue to work on communicating effectively with all members of our community and having them more engaged in the public education conversation.  Support of public education is critical for the future of our communities.  After speaking to so many residents during this campaign, I know that there are many people interested in this conversation and have great ideas on how to engage our communities more.\n\nOne other area I would like to see expanded across the Division is our early literacy program.  Recent data has shown that children are coming to school not prepared for kindergarten.  Programs like Literacy Links and Kindergarten Here We Come exists at certain schools in the Division but it would be wonderful if eventually all pre-school children had the opportunity to participate in these programs.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nIt has been my pleasure and honor to serve the children of this school division.

In particular, I would like to continue to work on our leadership initiative – “Setting Clear Expectations for Student Learning” which we launched at the beginning of last year.  \n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nIn the past eight years, I have served on all of the standing committees as well as numerous special committees and ad hoc committees.\n\nMy experience includes:\n\n* Chair, Finance and Planning Committee (2008 to present) \n* Chair, Human Resources and Policy Committee (2005-2008)\n* Chair, Buildings, Property and Transportation Committee (2002-2004)\n* Member, Buildings, Property and Transportation Committee (2005 to present)\n* Member, Communications and Community Relations Committee (2006-2007) \n* Member, Education and Communications Committee (2002-2004)\n* Member, Finance and Planning Committee (2004-2005)\n* Member, Non-Teaching Negotiations Committee (2002 to present)\n* Member, Building Support for Public Education Ad Hoc Committee (2006)\n* Member, Education Support Fund Committee (2002-2004)\n* Member, Workplace, Health and Safety Committee (2002-2003)\n* School Division Representative on the Fort Garry Community Network (2005-2006 and 2009 to present).\n\nMore information on my background in available on my website [www.david-johnson.ca](http://www.david-johnson.ca)\n\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nPembina Trails will face a number of important issues over the next year. If re-elected I will work to ensure that the Division’s top priorities are:\n\n* Student Academic Achievement – ensuring that students have the support they need to excel;\n* Ensuring that teachers have the support and resources that they need;\n* Ensuring that our schools provide a safe and caring learning environment;\n* Engaging our communities;\n* Providing prudent financial management.\n\nOur children must be our priority but in order to be successful, we must recognize, value and support the tremendous contribution of teachers.  We must also consult with and engage our various communities and stakeholders.   \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nWe have great schools and I would like to see things maintained in Pembina Trails, but there is always room for improvement.  Over the next four years I hope that we are able to do more to engage our communities and improve communication.  I think that we need to do more to promote the positive initiatives that take place in our schools every day to the 70% of residents who don’t have kids in school.  I also think that we have to do more to demonstrate and promote the value of public education.  \n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nIt has been my pleasure to represent the communities of Fort Garry, Linden Woods, Linden Ridge, Whyte Ridge and Tuxedo on the Board for the past eight years.  We have great schools throughout our Division.  I see firsthand the quality of education in our schools from my children.  I have also had the opportunity over the past few weeks to speak with thousands of residents of Ward 2 about the issues affecting our schools. While a number of specific problems and concerns have been raised, and will be dealt with, the overall message that I have been receiving has been very positive.  I hope to be able to continue be a part of the success of the Pembina Trails School Division over the next four years.

We need to ensure teachers have the adequate resources to teach the core subjects in addition to looking for new and creative ways to expand the students’ educational opportunities for the present and future.\n\nAvoiding Tax Increases without having our student’s education suffer.\n\nBetter use of Modern Teaching Methods and Technology: will better prepare our students for today’s ever changing world.\n\nLiteracy and Academic Excellence: I would work at helping improve literacy, math, and science skills in our division so students have the tools and ability to function in a fast paced environment.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nTS: I would like to increase community representation and involvement by creating opportunities for parents to have more input on school issues and priorities.  One suggestion would be to have virtual PTA meetings and periodic town hall meetings. \n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nTS:  I believe our children deserve to have an education system that provides them with everything they need in order to become the leaders of tomorrow. Their fate depends on how well we succeed. I would be honored to have the opportunity to work with all stakeholders to meet the needs of our future leaders.  \n\nMy motto is:  “A better future with a STRONGER education","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":22,"electoral_race_id":4,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.579-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.579-05:00"},{"id":22,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nPembina Trails School Division has grown into one of the best divisions in the province.  We, as a division are seriously addressing the educational challenges of the 21st century.  We have a goal of student success for all and are making the necessary changes to achieve that goal by addressing student engagement, the digital learner and the wonderful diversity of learners in our classroom.  After serving the division for 12 years and being part of its growth and development, I want to continue to contribute to the exciting opportunities for further improvement.  I am also presently involved with Manitoba School Boards Association as the Vice President.  In that role I have the opportunity to work with government and partner organizations to enhance the educational opportunities for students across the province. I am seeking the support of the community to continue this work, building a strong public school system and an excellent Pembina Trails School Division.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI am presently retired after 31 years of teaching in the Winnipeg School Division.  During my tenure with Winnipeg, I taught in the elementary classroom, physical education, resource and special education.  I worked as a divisional support teacher in both physical education and special education. I had the opportunity to contribute to a provincial curriculum in physical education and more recently the new social studies curriculum.  I was the cooperating teacher for many new teacher candidates.  These experiences have given me a broad perspective on the school system.\n\nI have been very active in my community as a volunteer Beaver leader, Heart and Stroke canvasser and coordinator, Ryerson Parent Council Vice President,  soccer coach, Fort Richmond Community Safety committee and President of the Pickerel Lake Cottagers Association.\n\nI am the parent of two sons, both of whom graduated from Fort Garry/ Pembina Trails School Division schools. That of course has given me the parent’s perspective on the public school system.  Both my sons, Matt and Grant Rayner have been active volunteers and coaches in our community as has my husband Brad Rayner.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nWith the increasing number of English as an Additional Language learners, in our system, supporting Newcomers to be successful in our society will be important. \n\nWe will need to expand the ways we collect and use data on student achievement to determine the supports required to ensure that every child is engaged, growing and graduating.  \n\nEducation has taken on many new roles as our society has shifted from a homogeneous, locally focused place to a diverse, globally focused world.  Schools provide supports to families, language acquisition, physical and mental health issues and preschool children. While I believe that schools should be supporting children in all these ways, it is a challenge to ensure that the community and the government understand the complexity of the new classroom and the need for on-going sustainable support for all the needs that go beyond the academic mandate.  Returning to a funding model less reliant on the local levy is important to achieve this sustainability.\n\nMaintaining safe and caring learning communities is an ongoing issue for all school divisions.  As society becomes more complex and diverse the need to teach respect and to protect the rights of all students is an ongoing concern.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?**\n\nNot something that I would change but something that I would like to see continue to grow  is the ongoing focus on engaging the 21st century learner, the digital native, those young people who have grown up with digital technology as a given in their lives.  I fully support the creative ways that teachers are addressing this through the use of the digital technology and creating integrated, relevant, problem based experiences to better engage these learners. For Pembina Trails one of the things this will mean is continuing to leverage the optic fiber technology to extend the exposure of our students to classrooms and learning opportunities around the world. \n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nOnly that it has been a privilege to serve the Ward 3 community over the past 12 years.  Having served as Vice Chair and Chair of the Board for four years was a very rewarding experience.  I have also served on or chaired each of the Board committees.   I have been on the Board of Winnipeg Technical College and served as Chair of their Board for two years.  My Manitoba School Boards experience has allowed me to participate on several provincial committees including the Art in Education Steering Committee, Teacher Practicum Committee, Residential Development Committee and the Aboriginal Education Committee.  I have enjoyed being a part of the on going improvement of Public Education in Manitoba and the establishment and growth of Pembina Trails School Division","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":23,"electoral_race_id":5,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.599-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.599-05:00"},{"id":23,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nI have been honoured to represent the Ward 3 community as a Trustee for the past twelve years.  I hope to be able to continue to work with the Board to continue to build and enhance a strong School Division, and to continue to provide the programs that educate and build capacity in the children of Pembina Trails.  \n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nIn addition to my experience as a Trustee, I was a member of the Board of Agassiz Child Care Centre for 17 years, and was chair or co/chair for many of those years.  I also volunteered for many years with Red River Nordic Ski Club as a Jackrabbits coach , board member and race organizer.  For a number of years, I volunteered for parent council and canvassed for charities in my community.  \n\nMy work experience includes work as a paralegal, both for law firms and for private industry.  I am currently the Executive Director of a regulated health profession in Manitoba.  \n\nMy son and a daughter both graduated from Pembina Trails Schools - my son from Vincent Massey Collegiate’s French Immersion program, and my daughter from Fort Richmond Collegiate.  My son completed a law degree and is currently an articling student.  My daughter chose a technical education and is successfully pursuing her career as a hairstylist.  Their experiences as they moved through school and made choices for careers gives me a perspective on the many choices children and their families make as they move through school and embark on life and education beyond high school.  \n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\n* I support collection of data to determine how well we are serving the needs of students.  PTSD has implemented programs to assess literacy across elementary grades and to measure student engagement across the division.  The global picture from these and other initiatives will assist in determining where future efforts should be directed.   \n* I support funding to English as an Additional Language programs in our schools.  We must ensure that students who have immigrated to Canada are successful in their transition to Canadian classrooms and society.  \n* I support initiatives to match educational practices to 21st century needs.  Students need to learn to assess and filter the torrent of information that we receive daily, and education must provide students with skills to integrate knowledge and understanding with these vast sources of information.  PTSD schools have begun exciting new initiatives to integrate learning across multiple subject areas to create the educational experiences that students need.  \n* I support initiatives to learn about best practices in education.  Our schools are working to understand and enhance student engagement.  This is a central issue in educational discussions within the Division, and I support programs to enhance student engagement across all grade levels.  \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI believe that Pembina Trails School Division is a wonderful Division with caring and talented teachers and staff.  I believe that our students receive an excellent education in a caring environment.  The changes that I would like to see in the Division are improvements on initiatives already begun – \n\n* to ensure that our students are safe, we need to continue to work with teachers, parents and students to eliminate bullying, \n* to ensure that our buildings are safe environments for students, we need to continue to upgrade safety measures such as lighting and security systems,\n* to ensure that our students are ready to learn, we need to continue to learn about what engages students, and provide programs that interest and fulfill our children as they spend each day at school.\n* to ensure that our students have excellent educational experiences, we need to continue to provide and improve opportunities for teacher professional development.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI hope to have the opportunity to continue as part of the Board of the Pembina Trails School Division.  The opportunity to learn and grow during the past twelve years has been a rewarding experience, and I am passionate about continuing to work on behalf of the children of Pembina Trails.   My experience on the Board has included two years as Chair of the Board, two years as Vice-Chair of the Board, three years as Chair of the Finance Committee, and I have served as a member or chair of all of the standing committees of the Board.  I have been a representative of the Pembina Trails School Board to the Board of Winnipeg Technical College for the past three years, and I am currently Chair of the Governing Board of Winnipeg Technical College.  I hope to be able to continue to serve the Division in similar roles for another four years, both to continue my own learning and to work to continue the history of excellence for the children of Pembina Trails","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":24,"electoral_race_id":5,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.613-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.613-05:00"},{"id":24,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nI decided to run for school trustee because of my children.  I have 3 young girls and I want them to receive a quality education.  I currently sit on the board for Richmond Kings Nursery School; through this experience it has made me realize that I want to keep contributing to their school careers as much as possible.  The more I researched the role the stronger I felt that this was the right path for me. \n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nMy background is agriculture.  I have worked for a major agriculture company for the past 10 years with a focus on quality.  I have been involved in creating and implementing a Canada wide quality system which requires detail and communication.  I have worked in a team environment my entire career; I understand the importance of open communication lines and the need to hear all sides before coming to a decision.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nI am a strong believer in extracurricular activities.  Children that have outlets to explore their ability and creativity help them discover who they are as individuals.  Children are faced with a lot of tough decisions throughout their school career; I would like to make sure they have a strong foundation to make the choices that are right for them.\n   \nTeachers have a hard job; they have large classrooms and limited resources.  I would like to continue to support our teachers by providing resources (training, effective in-services, teaching support and composition support).  Teaching requires a safe learning environment built on trust and respect.  We need to provide our schools with the tools to show children how to be responsible, compassionate people. \n\nThe African proverb “It takes a village to raise a child” holds a lot of meaning to me.  Children require support from a variety of people throughout their lives; parents, teacher, coaches, etc.  We all play a role in developing confident and happy children.  I want to help parents and teachers develop a strong relationship with open lines of communication. \n\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nMy overall vision for Pembina Trails is to maintain a caring and safe environment for our children to learn.  A school system that is respectful of everyone and provides children the opportunity to learn who they are as individuals and build confidence in themselves.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nWhen I think about my future and my family’s future it is focused on our children and their development.  We are just starting into the public school system with our oldest child and we will be very involved for many years to come.

Each child has unique talents and abilities and must  be given the opportunity to explore these.  I am committed to quality education for all students. All Students must have the help and programming available to grow to their potential.  Because of my experience as an educator  and a leader I believe I can make a contribution to the school board and Pembina Trails   Division .Please given me that  opportunity to provide a fresh perspective. on October 27.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nDuring my career as a registered nurse I have had leadership roles at St Boniface Hospital. I have taught nursing at Red River College, University of Manitoba and St Boniface Hospital. The majority of my career has been spent working with new parents and children or teaching about these developmental stages.\n\nI have been a strong advocate for young people with disabilities and mental illness and as a result of this became involved in lobbying and the political process.\n\nAlthough being a parent is not essential to being a school trustee, my experiences raising my own children has given me an understanding of the uniqueness and challenges of each child.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\n* Classroom composition and impact on student learning\n* Safety in our schools and bullying\n* The need for preschool programs, to address school readiness\n* Programming supports for Newcomers and Aboriginal students\n* Enhancing current technology in classrooms\n* Overcrowding of Pembina Trails High Schools\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nAs mentioned previously the high schools in the division are overcrowded. I would advocate for and lobby the provincial government to fund a new school. \nResearch has shown that the better prepared or ready a child is for school, the better they will do. Preschool programs would address some of these needs.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nFormative and summative learning are discussed in PTSD policies. I understand that in formative learning each child learns at his /her own rate and is allowed some flex in evaluation. Some research shows that in elementary school it may be better to allow the student to move on with their peer group. They can catch up with some additional help. However I have some serious concerns about this type of evaluation in junior high and up. I have had questions from parents in my ward about this issue. I would very much like to find out more information as to what is happening in our schools at this time.\n\nIn conclusion I would like to state that my entire decision making would be guided by  balancing between fiscal responsibility and quality education for our children","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":26,"electoral_race_id":5,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.634-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.634-05:00"},{"id":26,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nI believe in the Pembina Trails School Division, I sincerely believe that it is one of the best school divisions in the Province of Manitoba.\n\nWe have incredible teachers, administrators and families. My decision to run was to continue the momentum in building a strong foundation for our children and to be a voice that put the “public” back into public education.  I have a vested interest in the division, given that both my children, currently attend two separate schools within the division. I am committed to providing all of our families within the division quality education. Our children are our future, together we can provide them with the necessary resources to achieve success.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nMy experience is in business. In my current position, I manage an enterprise to which I am accountable to shareholders, the public and my staff. My business background has given me the privilege to open successful businesses across Canada. I am however very proud to call Winnipeg and Pembina Trails my home.  \n\nAs a multi-lingual person, I am conversant in Polish, Czech, Hindi, Punjabi, English and French. I believe that I can effectively listen to the diverse community that is the Pembina Trails School Division. \n \nGiving back to the community is a tenant that I believe in. I believe that community members need to give back in whatever ways possible to them. I have served as a board member to the Masala Mixer board which has made a $50,000 commitment, over the next 5 years, to our very own Victoria General Hospital though an annual fund raiser. Furthermore, I have sat on boards including Variety Club and  my children's respective schools and daycares. \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI want to see our division grow even further than it has, we have the potential and the responsibility to the community.  We are blessed to have a community in which our citizens come from all different cultural backgrounds, languages and beliefs.  Given this reality of a growing community, I foresee questions revolving around school expansion and technology in the classroom. Furthermore, we need to keep an eye on the basics revolving around our everyday curriculum: Math, science, language studies and art. \n\nWe have incredibly talented teachers, good resources and dedicated administrators all with one-common goal: our children.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI reflect back on a piece of advice my father gave to me: \n\n''As parent, I can only give you a solid foundation for which you can build what you choose, be it a skyscraper or a hut, I am only your foundation that is my limit, you have the potential to build as high as you choose.''\n \nI want to see our children build their skyscrapers –  together we can give them the strong foundation to achieve their goals and when we work together there will be no limit as to how high their skyscrapers will climb.  \n\nThanks, Dad.\n\nCaroline Mehra\nVote: Caroline Mehra – October 27th/201","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":27,"electoral_race_id":5,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.646-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.646-05:00"},{"id":27,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":28,"electoral_race_id":6,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.665-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.665-05:00"},{"id":28,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nThe education business is really the people business - big people and little people - but you need to have the facilities to get things done.  I alone openly opposed the School Board's initiative to close Westview and Sherwood schools at the Board table and in the school gymnasiums,  I also appeared before the Legislative Committee as an elected trustee in support of Bill 28 - a provincial initiative to freeze school closures across the province.  This bill was passed into law by the Manitoba Legislature - the highest authority in our province.  The closer the child is to her school the better - especially for early years children.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI hold an Arts degree from the University of Winnipeg, a Masters of Public Affairs degree from the University of Manitoba and two Certificates in the French language from College Universitaire de Saint-Boniface and L'Alliance Francaise.  I am a veteran trustee, presently a member of the River East Transcona School Board, an alumnus of Transcona Springfield School Board, an alumnus of Winnipeg City Council and a Past President and Honourary Life member of the Manitoba School Boards Association. \n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nThe retention of the present model - the delivery of educational services through a duly elected school board - which has the power to levy.  This approach allows the better targeting of dollars, a quicker reponse to community aspirations, and greater professional freedom to those who serve our children.  A similar provincial tax on property would make local educational decisions more distant and less reponsive while not changing the impact on the property tax payer.  This could happen - as in other jurisdictions - either through provincial ideology or poor school boards performance.  Removing school tax from property completely - which is a provincial responsibility and not a school board one - would significantly impact other taxes and make our province less competitive.  No school trustee, yours truly included, has enough broader provincial understanding, to make that call - it is fodder for our MLAs.  Trustee aspirants, who embrace such advocacy, are taking a popular position, which has no substance and is beyond their responsibility.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI would introduce a division wide bus and lunch program policy like we had in Transcona Springfield.  The present policy punishes the urban student despite the fact that the urban community pays 80 to 85 % of transportation costs which fall into local levy beyond the provincial grants - running into hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nMy candidacy is about our children - our treasure - our hope - our future,  The Haida first nation in British Columbia say it best - \"We do not inherit the land from our ancestors - we borrow it from our children.","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":29,"electoral_race_id":6,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.672-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.672-05:00"},{"id":29,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":30,"electoral_race_id":6,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.681-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.681-05:00"},{"id":30,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":31,"electoral_race_id":6,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.692-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.692-05:00"},{"id":31,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":32,"electoral_race_id":6,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.699-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.699-05:00"},{"id":363,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI decided to run in this upcoming election because I wanted to make a difference and be a voice for the kids, parents, teachers and for the administration. I have been volunteering in the community for the last 20 years in work sharing programs with students and been coaching basketball at every level(high school, community, district and the Filipino league). I fee that my people skills and having a close relationship with parents and students make me an ideal candidate . This district has a vast cultural diversity and ethnicity. I want to be active in the community and serve all people. I owned businesses in the area and support daily the community and district. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\n*20 years of volunteering in the community as a basketball coach and assisting with work education programs for students. \r\n*7 years of University. B.A in Economics and a B.A in Administrate Studies.\r\n*Management positions in past work experience\r\n*Market Analyst\r\n*Budgeting and Forecasting\r\n*People skills and a positive attitude\r\n*Mentoring and being a role model\r\n*International experience teaching and working with elementary kids, students and high schools.

Stop bullying and assist with depression. \r\n*Fundraising for programs and extra circular activities after school.\r\n*A breakfast program to feed kids who fall under the category of under privileged groups or under represented groups.  No kid should go hungry to school.\r\n*Provide basketball camps for free during summer months to kids in the community. I am a certified National basketball coach with national certifications. \r\n*Tackle gang issues and drugs in the school system.\r\n*Offer a program to reward exceptional students\r\nThe safety and welfare of our kids and student is extremely important to me. Also, to encourage healthy living and to participate in extra after school activities to promote team work and responsibility. As an active individual who takes health and fitness seriously I want to be active in the school system. I will personally donate $250/month if elected to deliver healthy meals to a classroom that has shown the greatest grade improvement and good work ethic. I will deliver those in person and will sit and listen to the kids and have lunch with them.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI want to represent fairness to all levels of schooling and education. I want to be an active voice of the community and serve the district in the most efficient manner. I feel that in the past school trustees are only representing the district in meetings with the School Board and most parents or students have no contact or communication with them. I want to be the voice of the people in the school division; to actively participate in programs, attend sporting events, talk to teachers, meet with principals, help students and parents and improve the overall educational system in the area. I truly appreciate the diversity of the community in ward 4 and I want to represent all  groups. \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI have been in the newspapers and T.V regarding my active work with kids.

The lack of real communication between schools and parents is a trend that needs to be addressed. \r\nWe need to have school trustees that have worked and been involved in the education system as it brings a real understanding to the working situations that trustees deal with. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI have worked in Winnipeg School Division for more than 15 years. I helped to create a Breakfast program in a middle school as well as running very successful fundraisers at all of the schools where I served as Parent Council chair.\r\nI am also the President of Sinclair Park Community Centre. As such, I am used to working with various styles of budgets and working with others to bring about vital changes that are required to ensure sustainable programs as well as maintaining fiscal responsibility.\r\nI have also served on several Board of Directors, such as the Hepatitis C Canada Board of Directors, and my daughters daycare Board of Directors. \r\nHaving worked with such diverse groups has allowed me to learn how to find realistic working solutions to problems and how to report back to the stakeholders that these decisions effect. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI want to focus on 3 major areas.\r\n\r\nThe first is the lack of funding available for families who have children who's learning abilities are challenged for various reasons. These children need access to Educational Assistants that are critical to helping them succeed in school and in life. These children and their families need to know that they aren't alone. \r\n\r\nThe second is to ensure that we are fully utilizing the volunteers that are so vital to the education system. Over the last several years many parents and other volunteers have not felt welcome in many of the schools. All of the studies show that students who's parents are involved in the school did better in school. As little as 10 years ago, it was standard to see volunteers in many of our classrooms, now there are next to none. We need to bring them back and ensure that they feel welcome and respected by all levels of the education system. \r\n\r\nThe third area is accountability and accessibility of school trustees. It is imperative that as elected officials there is a dissemination of pertinent information that affects the electorate in our ward. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nWard 8 of the Winnipeg School  Division is such a culturally diverse area. This diversification allows for the opportunity to grow and expand our understanding and acceptance of others that are culturally different from ourselves. \r\nWinnipeg School Division has created programming that recognizes the needs of children who require specialized education to ensure that they are supported and encouraged to reach their full potential. \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\n\r\n\r\nNo have interacted with parents and families for yearsans heard concerns that  must be acted on. We make a promise to educate these children and we are failing them. These children are our future and we need to invest in them. \r\n\r\nI want to be that voice that ensures we do our best to create and support a system that meets the needs of all of our children while ensuring the fiscal responsibility and accountability to all of the voters in the area.\r\n\r\nI want the voters to know and understand what we are doing at that affects them and their families. \r\nThere were changes made last year to the Ward system that voters are just learning about now. \r\n\r\nThis election, Winnipeg School Divsion will only be electing 1 person per Ward where in the past they elected two or three. More than ever, it is imperative to vote for a person who will represent the Ward in a way that ensures the concerns of the Ward are heard, a person who can work with other Trustees and be respectful, bring forth real issues that affect our children. I will be accountable, available and involved in the community.  \r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":303,"electoral_race_id":76,"created_at":"2014-09-17T00:14:52.763-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-30T08:31:20.287-05:00"},{"id":361,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nThe Winnipeg School Division school board sets policy for about half the public school students of the province.

(cost savings)\r\n-Embrace greater transparency in assessment and more peer and self assessment. with students and staff\r\n-Use the checkpoint assessments in the system at grades 3, (4 in French Immersion), 7, 8 and SY 4 to plan and track student performance.\r\n- Become less hierarchical in the org structure (cost savings)\r\n- Stop nepotism in hiring practices\r\n- Examine the Comprehensive Assessment Program (CAP) as a cost /benefit analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nAs the largest, most diverse, and oldest school division in the province, Winnipeg School Division, prepares Manitoba's citizenry for the challenges of the future.  Getting education right so that Manitoba remains a competitive, viable economic entity has never been more critical.  With Sheri Oberman on the board of the school division, Winnipeg School Division will continue to produce a world class education. \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nOne of the other candidates claims they were asked to run in this election, yet the endorsements on her website do not come a single person who pleaded with the candidate to run for election.  This is the kind of discrepancy I would notice in the claims set forth before me as a school trustee.

I experienced our schools as a student and for over 30 years as a teacher. Our division has grown and changed dramatically in this time, first with the Maples area, then Riverbend  and now with the development in Amber Trails. We are very much a multi-cultural division and need to intentionally build our communities around the common school experiences of children and their families. I have experienced the results of decisions made at the board level with regard to staffing, administration, buildings, grounds, student support and curriculum implementation. My experience instructs me on how such decisions affect children.   The education and well-being of children and their families is my greatest priority and has always guided me as a teacher.  I want to continue to make a positive contribution to the Seven Oaks School Division and thus have chosen to become a school trustee candidate.\r\n\r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nAs a taxpayer in the area I respect the necessity of making few dollars go a long way.  I know that there are some areas that can be tweaked to release funds that can be used to assist students in real and immediate ways.  Support for students can look very different on paper and as it translates into a classroom setting.  Supporting children and especially those with challenges is an area in which I have real experience and understanding.  \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nSchools must take a leadership role in supporting parents of young children.  Financially this is prudent as money spent on programs for young children, statistically preclude larger expenses spent later on older children who have “fallen through the cracks.” This leadership can be in areas of care, nutrition, literacy, numeracy, play and exposure to nature. I believe our families are ready to work with the schools in order to help their children become the best they can be. We currently have some fine programs but must reach further into our communities in order to expose more children to the opportunities available.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nOur division and particularly this ward is made up of children and families from all over the world.  Some communities are larger and more visible than others.  We must build on this cultural richness by increasing understanding and respect for all.   At the same time we must intentionally teach and create understanding and respect of our home in Seven Oaks and how it has evolved over the last three hundred years. Seven Oaks has a rich history that has been an integral part of the building of our province and nation.  All citizens should be respectful of this history and of our peoples as they in turn become part of Seven Oaks from many places in the world.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am an INDEPENDENT candidate. I have not asked for nor received outside funding from any political or organized groups.   Should I be a successful candidate for the Seven Oaks School Board I will pledge to take each and every discussion and decision seriously with no preconceived notions.  I will endeavor to find out all aspects of a situation and vote independently and with my conscience, keeping in mind the aim is always to benefit the children of Seven Oaks School Division. As a teacher my children experienced my care for them and for their families.   I am running for a school trustee position so that I might be in a position to effect change as I  CONTINUE TO CARE for the children of Seven Oaks School Division.  \r\n\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":296,"electoral_race_id":63,"created_at":"2014-09-16T23:44:07.758-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-12T13:26:47.773-05:00"},{"id":7,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nI decided to run to be the Mayor of Winnipeg because I believe that with the right leadership, vision and guidance, Winnipeg can fully realize its potential. \r\nWhen I decided to run, I saw a city that was plagued by scandal, audits and backroom deals. I saw a city that was struggling to maintain the quality of services and infrastructure that our citizens deserve. I want to bring positive change to the city of Winnipeg and restore our citizens’ faith in city hall by bringing openness and transparency to it. I will help rebuild our crumbling infrastructure by repairing our roads in the short-term, while supporting smarter growth of our city. \r\nI also decided to run to be the Mayor of Winnipeg because I want to make Winnipeg work better for its citizens.  I want a city that is open and transparent, that has better infrastructure, stronger and safer communities, and a real long-term economic plan. I want a better city for my family and for everyone elses families. I want to live in a city that supports small businesses and the creation of jobs. I want to live in a city that encourages our youth to stay in Winnipeg.\r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Mayor?\n\nI have always been a passionate supporter of Winnipeg. I have prided myself in being an active community volunteer and have had the pleasure of leading many of our city’s community organizations.  \r\nPreviously, I have been the Chair of the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce, and under my leadership, we launched the BOLD Initiative. My leadership and vision, assisted in bringing about the creation of YES!Winnipeg, The World Trade Centre, and the Centralia Conference (that showcased Winnipeg to 600 companies from 30 countries).\r\nIn my professional life, I am a privacy lawyer, and have been recognized as a national leader in the areas of social media, access to information, and privacy law. \r\nAs the Chair of the Winnipeg Art Gallery (WAG), it was my vision to increase the visibility and accessibility for the WAG.  As Chair, I supported greater programming for school children and a variety of non-profit community partners. This vision also helped the WAG continue to see strong surpluses and greater overall community engagement.\r\n\r\nI have also served on many other community not-for-profits, including, Ka Ni Kanichihk, the Manitoba Naturalists Society, and as President of the University of Manitoba Alumni. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Mayor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nIt is abundantly clear that infrastructure is the number one issue for Winnipeggers. One of the reasons that I decided to run for Mayor of Winnipeg is that I realized that as we approached a population of one million people, it was evident that our city would not be prepared for this due to years of poor leadership at City Hall and a lack of forward thinking vision. \r\nThe second major issue that has been identified from the beginning of this campaign was transparency at City Hall. As Mayor of Winnipeg, I will restore faith in City Hall by implementing our Open Data policy. \r\nFrom an infrastructure and development perspective, this means that the tendering process will be transparent. There will be no more backroom deals and all members of the construction industry (or any industry for that matter) will know the expectations are, and needs are, with respect to any given project. Everyone will be on the same playing field throughout the tendering process. \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the City of Winnipeg?\n\nSimply put, it is our people. I decided to run for Mayor, for our citizens, for our children and for Winnipeg. I am running for the Mayor of Winnipeg, in order to provide a positive, inclusive environment for all of our citizens.\r\nWe have the absolute pleasure of living in such a diverse community. This diversity will be celebrated and honoured throughout my service as the Mayor of Winnipeg. \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI encourage everyone to inform themselves of all of the candidates who are running and I encourage everyone to go out and vote. \r\nPlease feel free to visit my website for further information as to why I am running for the Mayor of Winnipeg.  It is my vision to have a city that is open and transparent, that has better infrastructure, stronger and safer communities, and a real long-term economic plan.\r\nI thank each and every one that I have met throughout this campaign. I thank you for your vote and I look forward to serving the City of Winnipeg as your Mayor. \r\n\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":8,"electoral_race_id":2,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.360-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-17T09:23:29.156-05:00"},{"id":252,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI wouldn’t be running for School Trustee if I didn’t care deeply about the future of students in Louis Riel School Division. I care about making sure students have access to a variety of programs. I care about making sure parents know what’s going on in our schools and with their children. I care about making sure teachers have the resources, tools, and support they need to do their jobs and to do their jobs well.\r\n\r\nI value our community and am motivated to engage our community in supporting the education of our students. I don’t have all of the answers to the challenges our schools and our school board face, but I believe that together we can find solutions because the future of our students is worth every effort. I believe that every student deserves the best we have to offer. Each child is precious and valuable and is worthy of our finest efforts. \r\n\r\nI would be so honoured to have the opportunity to serve as school trustee and join in the important discussions on defining and achieving success for students in Louis Riel School Division.\r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI reside in Royalwood and am active in the community. I’m currently a board meber of the Norberry-Glenlee Community Centre. I’ve always been passionate about working for the benefit of others and currently work at West Broadway Community Ministry – an organization that offers many services to people living in poverty. I’ve also worked as a Research Assistant to a City Councillor. \r\n\r\nMy volunteerism and commitment to the community have effected change both in organizational policy and community engagement. I have served as Co-Chair of the Youth Advisory Council to the Province of Manitoba and as a facilitator at the North End Youth Forum. I have developed strong relationships with many influential leaders through my dedication to many organizations in Winnipeg, throughout the province, and across Canada. I have received awards for my contributions including the Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, Manitoba Council on Aging Recognition Award, Lieutenant Governor’s Make a Difference Community Award, the Fred Douglas Foundation Humanitarian Award, and was a YWCA Young Woman of Distinction Award nominee. \r\n\r\nMy energy and passion for bettering the lives of others and close ties to the community will allow me to provide strong representation as a School Trustee.\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nThe safety of all students and staff is paramount to me. I support efforts to expand the School Resource Officer program and will advocate for increased safety in our schools. SROs work to build stronger relationships with youth and the community. Having a visible presence in our schools is a pro-active approach to reduce violence, bullying, drugs and other criminal activities. The role of the SRO is to provide support to students, parents, and school staff by answering calls for service regarding incidents occurring in schools. \r\n\r\nChildren who experience poverty are less likely to be ready for school, do well in school, and stay in school. I’m passionate about ensuring students and their families receive the necessary supports to allow children to reach their full potential. We can work towards supporting students by providing early intervention to help low-achieving students improve their reading and writing skills which are the necessary foundation for effective learning in all other subjects. Mentoring focused on academics is also an effective practice when addressing specific needs such as reading, writing, or math competencies. Teachers need to feel supported and have an avenue by which they can continue to develop skills. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nWe live in a diverse community. An important part of being a school trustee is staying in touch with community stakeholders. With more than 14,000 students and their families, as well as the larger community, it can be a challenge to communicate broadly and utilize communication resources wisely. I believe it's paramount that parents, teachers, and the community at large be informed and involved in school board decisions and activities. Actively seeking the expertise, perspectives, and ideas of those affected by decisions made by our school board makes people feel involved and valued. I believe it is important to take everyone’s view into consideration. \r\n\r\nLouis Riel School Division has been recognized for its work in addressing the social and emotional needs of students. I will serve as a strong advocate for increased awareness of mental health and wellness for students and educators. I am particularly interested in at risk youth and have a special interest in the mental health of children. Schools play a critical role in nurturing the development of children’s self-confidence, problem solving skills and other factors that contribute to mental health. I also believe that it’s important that educators have access to appropriate supports.\r\n\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI've faced a lot of criticism throughout this campaign.\r\n\r\nTheodore Roosevelt said “it’s not the critic who counts. Not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the person who is in the arena. Who’s faces is marred with dust and sweat and blood. Who strives valiantly. Who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly.” \r\n\r\nI’ve come to learn that the more you put yourself out there and take a stand for something you believe in, the more people come out of the woodwork and try to tear you down. You have to get used to it and shake it off if you want to come off the sidelines and be in the arena. \r\n\r\nI’ve also come to learn that you need to have a complete clarity of values, to not waiver from those values, and to know what your own value is. I value courage. I value accountability, honesty, and compassion. More than anything, I believe that every child is valuable.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":229,"electoral_race_id":68,"created_at":"2014-09-11T23:56:09.921-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-29T17:39:30.956-05:00"},{"id":213,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nWinnipeg has been very good to me and my family. Throughout my life and career I have tried to do good things and to give back to our community. I see elected office as another way to give back to the community and to try and solve the many serious and challenging issues facing the Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge Ward and our great City.\r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nI am a business person, and lawyer born and raised in Winnipeg. My wife Lisa and I have resided in the Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge ward for nearly 20 years, where we have raised our two sons.\r\n \r\nI hold a B.A. in political studies from the U of M, and a law degree (LL.B.) from Osgoode Hall Law School.\r\n \r\nFor 23 years, I practiced law as a partner at a Winnipeg law firm in the areas of real estate, corporate, commercial, and wills and estates.\r\n \r\nSince 2009, I have been President of Jernat Investments Ltd., a property investment firm.\r\n \r\nWe have made major contributions to projects like the Saul Morantz Building at the Simkin Centre, the CMHR, Community Respite Services, and the U of W.\r\n \r\nAs parents of a special needs child, Lisa and I have also contributed to the construction of the Variety Heritage Adventure Playground at the Forks, and have established the Nathan Morantz Autism Research Fund through Queen’s University.\r\n \r\nI serve on the board of Community Respite Services, the Refit Centre Foundation Finance  Committee and Shalom Residences Assisted Living. I am a past board member of the Manitoba Families for Effective Autism Treatment (MFEAT).\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nIn the Charleswood –Tuxedo- Whyte Ridge Ward I believe the single most important issue is traffic. Currently traffic flows through residential neighborhoods and down residential streets in an effort to avoid route 90.That is why I will work tirelessly to arrange for the funding required for the extension of the William Clement Parkway and the widening of Wilkes. We need to ensure traffic flows around residential areas and not through them. \r\n\r\nIn addition the City has a major infrastructure problem that must be addressed. Infrastructure is a key factor in both standard of living and economic growth.  \r\n\r\nAccountability and transparency are also a major issues in this election. Citizens have the right to know how civic projects are planned, paid for and completed.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nI think we are very fortunate to have the Assiniboine Park in our Ward.\r\nIt is an incredible gathering place for all citizens of Winnipeg and visitors to our great City.\r\n\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nThere are many very serious issues that the City must deal with including infrastructure, accountability, transparency and taxation. These issues will require a city council comprised of serious minded, experienced people that will need to make difficult decisions for the benefit of the City. I have spent over 20 years practicing law, and in business, and have the necessary skills and life experience to get the job done. At this point in my career I would like to bring my skills and passion to City hall to help make Winnipeg an even better City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":209,"electoral_race_id":44,"created_at":"2014-07-08T23:52:33.992-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-29T22:16:22.808-05:00"},{"id":214,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nAs a Winnipegger, I became frustrated with how business was being done at city hall and how the issues that faced Winnipeggers was being ignored or being handled with only half the attention it needed. Instead of complaining, i decided i wanted to do something about it. Already having a passion for politics and wanting to make Winnipeg a better place to live i decided to run for city council to offer an alternative and to bring new ideas to the city. Ideas with forward thinking, independence, and sustainability at it's heart.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nMost of my working life i have worked in the customer service sector and volunteerism. With this, i have the experience of always having people at the heart of every discussion and always meeting the needs of people, especially for those who may be in difficult situations in their lives.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nSustainability, Accountability, Accessibility. Going forward ensuring that as we grow as a city we are doing so in these 3 fashions, to ensure they're sustainable in economic, financial, and ecological terms. \r\n\r\nOther issues i find important are similar to those that Winnipeggers have been voicing, the concerns over infrastructure, transit, taxation, roads, and community centres. Transit is particularly close to me. As a child and even as an adult. Financial difficulties have made it hard to own a vehicle and i've had to rely on Transit to get to and from work, and because of improper transit services, many employers would not consider my application for work, closing many doors to me for finding good work with good pay. This is a reality for many people today and improper transit services will only make it harder for people to find work. Proceeding with Rapid Transit, Night-owl Transit, expanded Sunday service, along with major overhauls of scheduling for transit and expansions are needed if we want to make our city more sustainable, and accessible for all. 1 Bus can hold the passenger load of 50 cars. Which does more wear on our roads? 1 Bus? or 50 cars?\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nVery community orientated. Residents take pride in their neighbourhood of being suburban, and wanting it to continue to be a slice of an oasis in a city. We have numerous parks, trails and dedicated community groups that want to improve our neighbourhood. Many families can easily trace back their beginnings in this neighbourhood from well over 100 years ago.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI want to continue with my positive campaign and to always keep open ears to all ideas from residents to ensure we get the change we deserve.  \r\n\r\n\"Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done.\"\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":210,"electoral_race_id":43,"created_at":"2014-07-09T00:15:37.758-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-30T03:09:51.607-05:00"},{"id":217,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nThere are two main reasons I decided to run. \r\nFirst is the state of our infrastructure and the amount of work that is needed in the upcoming years to eliminate the $7 billion deficit our city is now facing. Being a Transportation Engineer will give much needed knowledge on City Council to properly assess and provide oversight for this work.\r\n\r\nThe second, and main reason I decided to run, is a huge disappointment in what has happened at City Hall in recent years. With policies and procedures not being followed, the mayor and his members of EPC (including St Vital's current councillor) voting against having real estate audits performed on questionable dealings with the new firehall, new police station and other land transfer deals and then even voting against having the findings of the audits reviewed by the Justice Dept at the Province, I had enough. I want to help regain Winnipeggers' trust in City Hall, which is currently at an all time low. In 2013, 67% of Winnipeggers thought they were getting good value for their tax dollars. In 2014 that number dropped to 36%. Do we want the same people on Council? Time for change.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nMy background as a Transportation Engineer would be invaluable on City Council. The knowledge I have of multi-million dollar projects and the oversight I would be able to bring to Council would be a great benefit. I have been involved with the design and construction of numerous regional streets projects, residential streets projects and many active transportation projects and studies. I was also involved with the construction of Winnipeg's Water Treatment Plant for three years.\r\nKnowing how various infrastructure components are actually built and knowing what the cost is to do various projects will help avoid another situation where millions and millions of dollars have been wasted at City Hall over the past couple of years. \r\n\r\nHaving fresh ideas and not being influenced by any political party, union or business is the only way to ensure I do my job as St Vital residents' representative at City Hall. Having ties to anyone makes you beholden to them and then those ties influence your decisions. How can a councillor be impartial when voting on contract negotiations with a union that is supporting you? That type of behaviour is partially to blame for the situation Winnipeg is in right now.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nGiven my background, obviously infrastructure would be my number one issue and specifically the condition of gravel back lanes in parts of St Vital. I have some realistic ideas to get all the gravel back lanes in St Vital replaced with either asphalt or concrete. I want to change the Local Improvement Process to reduce the amount of paper work required for approval and I also want to reduce the amount local residents have to pay themselves. I would like to change the 50% payment requirement to 30% or 25%.\r\n\r\nI want to ensure the active transportation network is developed to full completion in St Vital within the next four years. The number of families, children, seniors and commuters would all benefit from an integrated active transportation network throughout St Vital that will tie into other areas of the city.\r\n\r\nI also want to continue to improve our local community centres. St Vital is one of the largest communities in Winnipeg both in size and population. Support of program availability to all members of St Vital is a large priority as it enhances the way of life in the area.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nWhile door knocking I have found that no matter what area of St Vital anyone lives in, they all take great pride in their neighbourhood. The city should be helping to build up this pride. Whether it's business associations like Old St Vital BIZ, local elementary, junior high or high schools, seniors' residences or family homes, everyone wants their street or neighbourhood looking the best it can be. When something isn't right or needs repair, people want to see action to correct it. Representing St Vital means dealing with residents' concerns and not ignoring them. \r\nI want to help build on the community pride by representing St Vital at City Hall. I have lived in St Vital for the past 23 years so I know what the community means to people and what it means to my family and me.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am not associated with any political party, union or business. I don't believe that the civic level is any place for party politics. City Councillors should be completely independent in order to properly represent all residents of their ward. I have been asked many times which party do I support. I don't support any party. When I vote, I vote for who I believe has the best ideas at the time.\r\n\r\nHaving an engineer on City Council would be a huge benefit to the city. Infrastructure is Winnipeggers' number one concern. The technical knowledge, understanding and ability to provide proper oversight is lacking on Council. I want to fill that gap.\r\nI am running for City Council for one reason - to do what I can to help the city. I am not looking to further any political career. I'm not a politician. I am in this for what I believe are the right reasons.\r\n\r\nI hope everyone gets informed about their choices. Do some research and don't vote blindly. If we want change, we have to vote for change. Winnipeg and St Vital deserve better than what we've received over the past few years.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":211,"electoral_race_id":54,"created_at":"2014-07-12T02:57:52.380-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-29T23:27:33.975-05:00"},{"id":287,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI am seeking re-election in my ward.  I first decided to run as a School Board Trustee as I wanted to be the voice for parents with children.  I remain passionate in the belief that our children need to feel safe while at school and should want to be at school.  There must be a broad range of programs offered to our students including the arts, sports and special education.  It is really important our children are provided with the best options available.   Our children must be properly prepared to transition into the world after they graduate from our high schools.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI have always been active in the community including volunteering as a board member at the daycare centres my daughter attended – Fairlane Children’s Centre and Lakewood Children’s Centre.  I was a member of the Parent Council at Lakewood Elementary for six years.  I continue to volunteer Friday evenings to chaperone the dances at the Assiniboia-West Community Centre (even though my daughter has not attended for four years!) as well as volunteer duties at many different events held at the community club.  My daughter sang in the St. James Divisional Senior Choir and I have chaperoned most choir field trips and events for seven years.  I was the fundraising co-chair for the St. James-Assiniboia Divisional Choirs for three years.  I held positions of President, Secretary and Treasurer on the board of directors of Winnipeg Condominium Corporation #1 (Birch Park Condos) for 15 years.\r\n\r\nI am the current Chair of the Education Committee, I am a member of Personnel Committee, Early Childhood Development, Marketing, Board representative for the Student Council.  I have been appointed by the Manitoba School Board Association as the representative on the Provincial Arts Curriculum Review Committee.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nThe reason I became a School Trustee was to be an advocate for students, to have a voice and be the parents’ voice.  \r\n\r\nWe must ensure our schools stay focused on student achievement, safety and student wellness.  We continue to have a broad range of programs available including the Arts, Sports and French Immersion and assisting those with special needs.\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nDuring my daughter's education in the division we were fortunate to have amazing teachers who taught her well academically, guided her and were always there for their students.  My daughter's grade four teacher from elementary attended their graduation ceremony as she wanted to see \"her kids\" graduate!  \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI grew up Crestview and live in St. Charles.  My parents and sister also still live in the area.  I attended Buchanan Elementary, Hedges Middle School and John Taylor Collegiate.  My daughter attended Lakewood Elementary, Hedges Middle School and graduated class of 2014 at John Taylor Collegiate.  My nephew is currently in grade 12 at John Taylor Collegiate.\r\n\r\nI love being a School Trustee.  It has allowed me to stay involved in all aspects of the Division.  All of our School Division employees are an amazing, caring group and definitely have all our students’ best interests in the forefront.\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":56,"electoral_race_id":61,"created_at":"2014-09-13T01:47:46.618-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-03T10:42:44.896-05:00"},{"id":32,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nI am a parent to two children in the RETSD school system (in Westview School and Ecole Centrale).  In the 2007-2008 school year my daughter's school, Westview, was slated to be closed by the school division due to declining enrolment.  This united both affected parents like myself and neighbourhood residents to keep the school open.  This kind of community action shows why we need a voice on the board that is interested in keeping our schools open as a vital link in the community.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI have several years of experience on volunteer boards as a 20-year member of Toastmasters; I have served on all positions of my club executive as well as area governor and in several district leadership roles.  Trustees also must be excellent communicators with their constituents, something that my Toastmasters background has afforded me.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nAs mentioned before, I want to be a champion to keeping our schools open as vibrant parts of our community, and maximize their roles as community hubs.  I am also firmly against any \"no fail\" policy, and I'm for making sure that school division funding is not covered by homeowners on their property tax bill in any way, but instead funded as a core service from general provincial government revenue.  Finally, I want to ensure that the public is always aware of what is going on at school board offices, and I intend to make residents informed through websites, social media, and printed newsletters.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI would like to have the public to be made more aware of the important business that goes on at the school board offices, as mentioned above.  I would also like to have teachers be fully utilized in their role that we have entrusted them with and make the best use of their time - for example have a rotating list of teachers who would be able to watch children at their lunch hour instead of the \"corporations\" set up by parents that charge a profit for this as in some schools in the ward.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nSchool should be a place of great achievement for our children, a place where they learn the necessary skills to become productive members of our society.  My aim is to make schools a safe place to build our children's future, and to keep our schools as cornerstones of the communities that they are a part of.","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":33,"electoral_race_id":6,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.709-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.709-05:00"},{"id":33,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":34,"electoral_race_id":7,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.743-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.743-05:00"},{"id":34,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nOn Easter Sunday April 2006 our family experienced first hand what happens when the “system” lets a child down. There was no one from the healthcare system to advocate for our 15 year old son. We placed our faith in the system and he died needlessly from a totally treatable but undiagnosed case of bacterial meningitis. He had been ill for several weeks, lost 50 pounds and had all the classic symptoms yet he was sent home from the emergency ward only to return a couple of days later and was brain dead less than 48 hours after that on his brother’s birthday. In October 2006 with encouragement from families in the community I decided to run and was fortunate to be elected to my first term. This community gave our family support when we needed it most. I want to give back by continuing to be a strong advocate for the children. Many individuals use school trusteeship as a “stepping stone” to kick start their political careers. I do not share this philosophy. I believe our children really “are” our future and we must invest our time and resources very carefully. \n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI have:\n\n* Been a long time resident and a committed partner in raising sons John and James (KEC) so my wife, Wendy, could return to her 27-year teaching career in the River East Transcona School Division.\n* Regularly attended Parent Advisory Council meetings for 14 years at Mission Gardens Play Centre, John de Graff, Joseph Teres, Valley Gardens, and Kildonan East as a parent, council executive and as a school trustee.\n* Served as chair on the Finance Committee for the last 2 years and I’m committed to status quo budgeting obtaining a 0% tax increase for 2010/2011.\n* Assisted in negotiations with labour groups – Maintenance, Paraprofessionals, Clerical, Transportation and Library Technicians.\n* Served as a member on Programs, Policy Review and Personnel Committee.\n* Graduated from the University of Winnipeg with a BA (Honours) Psychology degree and wrote my thesis on developmental child psychology.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nWe must always be vigilante in our spending and spend where it benefits the students most directly such as in math and reading recovery programs. Our school division has a comprehensive purchasing and tendering policy that is based on both the legislated requirements of the Public Schools Act and industry best practices. We must invest in the long term efficiently. I encouraged a pilot program that is presently reviewing and ensuring that education is relevant for current employment readiness standards. I spearheaded recorded voting and will continue to help ensure accountability and transparency in the Board.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI would like to see increased support in classrooms- making both the environment and the experience conducive to learning. I also believe that we need to work harder in developing partnerships with parents, business and the community. I would also like to see improvements in space and facilities available to our students in both the vocational and academic areas. I believe there has to be a more equitable way to fund education than through property taxation while at the same time not losing local autonomy. I also support the idea of a standardized provincial report card that is more understandable to parents.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI have always been very involved in the River East Transcona community. I’m known to many young people as “Papa John” or “Big John” and even “Santa” to many preschoolers. Our family will be forever indebted to this community and they have been gracious enough to give me a purpose. I would be honoured to serve our community and advocate for the children for another four years. I believe only one thing happens when we cut corners in heathcare and education and it usually isn’t good. I have and will always act in what is in the best interests of the children. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to share my thoughts and experiences. I would like to dedicate this to my sons “Little” John (1991-2006) and James and their friends who have accepted me as their friend.\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":35,"electoral_race_id":7,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.754-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.754-05:00"},{"id":35,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nI’ve lived in my neighbourhood for 21 years, and have worked in it for the last four at one of the schools (SMP) as an Educational Assistant. I have 2 kids (1 school age and one younger) and I want to make things the best for them they can be and the other kids I work with. I also have some people in my life that I really admire who have been involved in politics. They’ve shown me the value of public service.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nMy time working in the school has given me a real clear insight into what the schools really need from a grassroots level. I have proven over and over that I am rational, calm, organized, and thorough. I also spent 3 years in the accounting field where I was known for my attention to detail.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nThe major issues are making sure that all students are getting a safe and equitable education. My reasons are obvious.\nInfrastructure is obviously important as well, as it houses the education process. Roof repairs in many places are due given all the damage caused last year.\n\nNo school closures in our division. This decision should be left in the Board’s hands and not the provinces, as the board will be the one(s) to find a solution. My reason is because of the importance of schools in a community. Nothing could be worse than a vacant school.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI would like to see term limits for trustees so as to not discourage young people from getting/staying involved (if they lost an election to a senior incumbent).\n\nI would also like to see contracts with all the employee groups NOT end during election years. Groups have been left without a contract to make it look like sitting trustees have ‘frozen’ taxes. This is unfair to employees and deceitful to taxpayers. Plus, where does the back-pay come from when contracts are resolved if there is a shortfall?\n\nLastly, I’d like to see the school tax portion on a person’s property taxes reduced to zero, or close to and the balance collected by the province…like everything else under the provinces jurisdiction.

As a member of his school’s parent council, I want to work to better the learning environment for all students in the division.  The second reason has been my involvement in the educational system for the past 17 years.  I have had the opportunity to initiate programs both in the classroom and as extracurricular activities for students across the province.  These programs include partnerships with local community groups (Winnipeg Amateur Radio Club, Royal Astronomical Society), post-secondary institutions (University of Manitoba, University of Winnipeg, University of North Dakota), and numerous industry partners.  I would like the opportunity to expand my experience to the school board level.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI have been working in the education system for 17 years.  As a teacher, I have an understanding of educational theory and policy that allows me a greater insight into the needs of students, parents and the community where they reside.  My experience allows me to have an open dialogue with these groups and work with our teachers and their support team to enhance student experience.  I have also been a part of the Manitoba Teachers’ Society Educational Finance Committee for 10 years, which has provided me with insight into the area of school board budget development. \n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nTwo major issues for me are level of student support services and declining enrolment.  As the second largest division in the province, River East Transcona School Division is ranked 20th out of 38 school districts in Manitoba when it comes to spending on student support services relative to total enrolment.  Seven years ago River East Transcona was ranked 8th in the province.  As I meet with parents, teachers, and support service staff, all have indicated that there is an increase in the need for student supports and I feel that this must be addressed.\n\nDeclining student enrolment is occurring in most of Manitoba’s school divisions.  It is imperative that the River East Transcona School Division board not only maintain, but continue to improve program delivery for its students in a financially responsible manner.\n\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nThere needs to be greater transparency in the school boards budget consultation process.  River East Transcona School Division holds a public consultation on the development of the budget, but it does not fully disclose revenue and expenditure streams in the process.  The division needs to provide the public its proposed budget in the form of the existing provincial FRAME (Financial Reporting and Accounting in Manitoba Education) reporting system.  Further, the public consultation must be held early enough so that community input can be incorporated into the final budget that is submitted to the province in March of each year.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI personally believe I have a lot to offer as a trustee of the River East Transcona School Division.  I have been an active member of this community all my life and an alumnus of the school division.  As a trustee, I will be a voice in the boardroom as an energetic member of the community.  I will bring experience and understanding of educational innovations and classroom practice with my 17 years of teaching.  As decisions are being made at the board level, I will provide an insight into the impact decisions have on classroom practice, program delivery, school policy and ultimately on our students and their families.\n \nStudents in the River East Transcona School Division deserve the opportunity to reach their full potential.  If elected to the board of trustees, I hope that my work will ultimately affect the graduation rates of students in the River East Transcona School Division, and the future options of post secondary study so they can be effective leaders in our community.","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":40,"electoral_race_id":9,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.810-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.810-05:00"},{"id":40,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nI am concerned with the lack of direction of the previous board.   There has not been a renewal of a strategic plan for the division and ultimately this rudderless approach will affect the quality of education for our students and staff.  \n\nEvery large organization needs a focus and a plan for the future and proper assessment to ensure it is meeting its goals.   I intend to bring a sense of purpose to the Board and a commitment to its direction.\n\nI believe that all children deserve the opportunity for a better education.   I believe that our teaching methods must provide them with the tools, the technology and the desire to achieve success.   Our schools must be a safe environment for everyone and open to the entire community, for people of all ages and activities, because education is a life-long adventure.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\n My experience includes 11 previous years as a Trustee in this division, including 3 terms as Chairman of the Board.   I hold a Certificate in Public Sector Management from the University of Manitoba, in addition to my regular studies at the Faculty of Architecture.   \n\n  My business experience of over 20 years includes co-ownership of a retail furniture store, Roche – Bobois, which imported designer furniture from all over Europe.   Recently, I retired as a provincial civil servant after 19 years with the Dept of Culture \u0026 Heritage, Administration \u0026 Finance.   I am very familiar with the workings of large organizations.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nMajor issues include:\n\n* Removal of Education Tax on Property.       The Province currently only funds 50 % of education, off-loading the remainder onto the local ratepayer.   Education is a provincial responsibility and should be funded 100 % as are Health, Social Services, Justice and all other government departments.   \n \n* Graduation Rates.   Approximately 4 of 10 students are not graduating from High School.   Let’s find out why and target to improving the ratio, and more importantly, the future of the students themselves.\n\n* Pass/fail Social Engineering.   The Division does not have a pass/fail policy, however in practice; children do not fail a grade.   This does not benefit the child as they will not have a basic understanding of the previous grade.    I would establish a remedial program to upgrade their skills and knowledge prior to failing a grade.   Of necessity, this would require timely and accurate assessment of the student during the school year, not at the end.\n\n* Safe Schools.   This would include bullying and the elephant in the room, drugs.    There are pushers operating in our schools, looking for life-long customers.   Let’s root them out by using every means available and get them out of the system.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI would like a united Board to focus upon the major issues outlined above.   There are the regular operational issues that the Board must attend to yearly: Budgeting, Collective Agreements, Staffing, Transportation, Maintenance, etc.   I think that we have to also look beyond caretaking duties and begin to establish a vision, a purpose and a commitment for the future.    I believe the division has to establish a \"relentless pursuit of excellence\" as the guiding principle of its existence. \n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI will not bring a personal agenda to board business.   As a true independent candidate, I am not indebted to special interest groups or private organizations; I am accountable solely to the electorate as a whole.\n\nI am concerned about the standard and quality of education.  No child should \"fall through the cracks.\"   Students MUST have more than the basic skills to enable them to compete and indeed excel, not only in the workforce, but also as productive citizens of our society.   They deserve that chance.   You deserve that assurance.   I am committed to making it happen.

School Trustee is a perfect role for me and one that I have great desire to give for the benefit of our families, our students and our educators.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\n* I am a parent of school age children sharing the same hopes and concerns of every parent and facing the same issues as all parents of public school students;\n* A decade of working with school-age child care centers located in our division schools and dealing with multiple parties’ interests and policy matters;\n* Immersion in our community both as a board member of the River East Ringette Association and having both children actively participating in community sports;\n* Both my employment and my board affiliations have given me years of successful management, legal knowledge, strategic planning and policy creation experience;\n* Proven communication strength in all that I do;\n* My unwavering passion to work for the benefit of children.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nAs I campaign door-to-door, the residents have clearly conveyed that the no-fail, social promotion idea is of great concern. The teachers feel pressure to move a student along through the grades; the parents are upset that their child is being passed without sufficiently meeting course outcomes; the business owners are concerned about the less-than-quality employee options available to them; and the students are worried about their ability to compete after graduation. We need to find better ways to deliver high education standards balanced with appropriate self-esteem support.\n \nLike and dislike of multi-grade classrooms is also being raised. There are situations where a multi-grade classroom and the better utilization of our resources (classroom space, equipment, and teachers) could make the difference between closing or maintaining a low enrolment school. Multi-grade classrooms can sometimes be the best option and there is a lot of research available on the positive cooperative nature of a multi-grade. It is an option that should not be dismissed by any trustee and requires full consideration in particular situations.\n \nI chose those two issues as they have been the most often raised during my past month of meeting with Ward 5 residents.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI would strive to improve the level of transparency available to our residents as the publicly available minutes of the trustee meetings are not sufficient to convey to interested residents the work the board is performing. I would also do what I can to increase the division efforts on the zero-tolerance bullying policy. Children need to feel safe before they can focus on their studies, and they need to fully comprehend the power of their internet communications which can so easily escalate to cyber-bullying.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI invite residents to visit my website: [www.jananderson.ca](http://www.jananderson.ca) and, as many who have emailed or phoned me during this campaign period already know, I am available and welcome their thoughts, questions, suggestions and complaints. Should the voters show their confidence in me by electing me as a School Trustee, I promise I will give them the full power of my unquestionable work ethic and my passionate desire. Revitalization of any board is crucial to bring fresh perspective and innovative ideas and election time is the opportunity for voters to do so. I strongly encourage all residents to exercise their voting right on October 27, 2010, and I would be honoured to receive their vote and represent their interests,\n\nThank you,\nJan Anderson\nCandidate for School Trustee, Ward 5\nRiver East Transcona School Divisio","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":43,"electoral_race_id":10,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.851-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.851-05:00"},{"id":43,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":44,"electoral_race_id":10,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.861-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.861-05:00"},{"id":44,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":45,"electoral_race_id":10,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.872-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.872-05:00"},{"id":45,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nI decided to run for the school board out of my concern for the future of our children’s education. Our family has lived 37 years in the North Kildonan and our daughter graduated from the RETSD. Soon we will have two grandchildren entering the River East Transcona School Division. I like many of you are alarmed and concerned by the emphasis of a “no fail /social promotion” and with use of multi grade classrooms policies. Many of these experimental teaching methods have failed in the past at the expense of our students’ education. No student can afford their loss of education nor should they. I concluded it was time for me to step up and offer the electorate change and the promise of a proper education for our youth, not compromised by experimentation of new methods of teaching. I want to ensure our children’s abilities and future is not compromised and the most important focus is ensuring the best possible education is available for our students. \n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI believe my many years of experience and knowledge of working with residents, neighbourhood associations, students bodies, parents, community leaders and other elected government officials will allow me to bring my dedication, commitment and leadership capabilities into focus towards working for a better education system. I have the proven ability to influence, engage and to be a strong voice at the school board level on behalf of students, parents and grandparents in our community. They can count on me working continuously on their behalf making the necessary educational improvements for a brighter future.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nWhile meeting with the residents in community and hearing their concerns, I would say the major issues are school taxes, the moratorium on school closures, multi grade classrooms, standardized testing and standardized report cards and the “no fail policy or social promotion policy”. \nI strongly believe the Province of Manitoba must be convinced to remove school taxes from the property tax bill as there is no direct correlation to services provided to ones home. Secondly it is imperative the Province of Manitoba’s remove the moratorium on school closures, which will allow respective School Boards to govern accordingly. Thirdly, I am extremely concerned about the use of multi grade classroom approach to education, as it will affect student’s ability to learn at their grade level and will no doubt compromise their education. I believed the standardized testing and standardized report cards would provide the education and knowledge level to be implicit and measurable to other school divisions throughout the Province of Manitoba. Finally, I cannot support the principle of a “no fail policy or social promotion policy” which does not provide students with a true understanding of reality.   \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI would like an opportunity to assist our students in excelling in their studies, to feel safe in their schools and celebrate their knowledge and successes. Our schools have many dedicated and resourceful teachers who need our support. We need caring School Trustees who are willing to work with parents, grandparents and teachers in achieving the best possible education and future for our students! I want to make certain our education system provides every possible avenue of opportunity for success to our students. \n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nAs an independent candidate for School Trustee in Ward 5, I believe my knowledge and experience will afford the assurance that your School Trustee is able to provide and is prepared to make the necessary sacrifices to make certain our students’ interests and education comes first. It’s important your School Trustee provides the kind of representation you need when it comes to defending a proper education and to ensuring we secure the opportunity of a great future for our children. \nI make this personal pledge to you, with your support and vote on Wednesday, October 27, 2010 you can count on me being a School Trustee with a clear understanding and awareness of our children’s educational needs in the River East Transcona School Division and you can also count on me working continuously on your behalf!","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":46,"electoral_race_id":10,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.882-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.882-05:00"},{"id":46,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nI want to be the community’s partner in supporting public education. I have the education and work experience that a school trustee requires. I understand that school trustees are not there to push their personal opinions, but instead they are there to:\n\n* act as a member of a team\n* establish and review policies\n* be accountable to the Province of Manitoba and to the community members within the division\n\nMost importantly, I will be there to ensure that the needs of the students come first.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nAs a business owner, an educator and a past civil servant, I bring a lot of work experience to the table. \n\nOne example is my budgeting experience. Currently, I oversee the financial management of a successful training and consulting company. While working in government, I helped manage a multi-million dollar budget for a department that had to work with constant budgetary restrictions and cutbacks.\n\nWith my experience as an educator, I know what it’s like to be in the classroom. I understand the daily challenges and pressures that teachers have. \n\nAs a civil servant, I worked in the department of Healthy Living on school-based programs. I worked with the administrators and teachers in all the schools in Manitoba. In the years that I was there, I gained an understanding of the unique partnership school divisions have with the Government of Manitoba. I also had the opportunity to see the various approaches and models the divisions throughout Manitoba are using to create a valuable and educational experience for all students.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nThe River East Transcona School Division can improve on its community engagement. The school board needs to be proactive in finding ways to encourage community members to participate and share their opinions. \n\nAs a school trustee, I will improve community engagement by:\n\n* maintaining a website to keep all community members informed\n* sharing the board meeting minutes  \n* acting as a liaison between the school board and our community\n* voicing the education issues of our community\n* seeking the opinions of all members of our community and communicating those opinions to the board \n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI understand and know that the school board operations are often set by provincial legislation or policy. \n\nAs school trustee, I will support decisions that will create a safe and stimulating learning environment for all students within the division. I will accomplish this goal by working as part of a team with the other elected trustees. I will also take the time to be an informed board member by seeking the opinions of the community and by researching and analyzing all possible options.\n\nI have a strong desire be an accountable and dependable community representative and I would be honoured to have your vote.","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":47,"electoral_race_id":10,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.891-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.891-05:00"},{"id":47,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nThe idea was first introduced to me by a parent following a meeting with a school to negotiate his daughter’s return back to school while addressing her special needs. From there I began to explore the role and responsibilities of a trustee. I met with past and current school trustees, teachers, principals, superintendents, and students. I believe my years of advocating for children/adolescents and their families, and my lifelong dedication and passion to improving the lives of children and adolescents are the skills and experiences required to be a school trustee representing the community. \n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nThe experience I offer to the role as a future school trustee is as follows:\n \n* 25 years working with children and adolescents as a Registered Psychiatric Nurse at the Manitoba Adolescent Treatment Centre. \n* Professional and a compassionate understanding of child/adolescent development and impact these stages have on the family unit and schools. \n* Extensive experience and knowledge of Board governance. I have been a local, provincial and national Board member on various health and public service Boards. \n* An extensive history of being an effective labour negotiator.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\ni. Safety and health of schools, students and staff – many of the schools in St. James-Assiniboia (SJSD) are greater than 25 years old if not older. Upgrades to electrical, heating, ventilation, washrooms, floor conditions, and roof conditions. \n\nii. To maintain a learning environment that is free from harassment. There needs to be ongoing education and awareness promoting a zero tolerance for violence \u0026 bullying. \n\niii. The declining enrolment within (SJSD). In the past 20 years 15 schools have been closed within SJSD. Our current student enrolment is 8500 students. In comparison to other school divisions in Winnipeg, SJSD has the lowest total enrolment. My concern is when a school is closed due to low enrolment – what happens to the students of that school? What is the impact on the community? Are there alternative uses for the school – such as adult learning centres, alternative learning / programing centres? What could happen to our division if the enrolment continues to decline? Could SJSD be amalgamated with another school division? I commit to be proactive, creative and strategize with the school board and the community in ways of increasing enrolment rates and to avoid a possible amalgamation of SJSD with another school division. \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\ni. Exploring the implementation of a partnership(s) with health care agencies – and not using education funds. Currently there are no primary health care education/ services within the school division. This could include but not be limited to occupational therapists, physical therapists, and nursing services. I have a successful history of negotiating these kinds of partnerships within the community.\n\nii. The development of a student advisory committee bringing youth from all middle school and high schools within the division so they, as “consumers”, can express their views/concerns to the trustees. This will allow for a more open and accessible Board and possibly encourage more youth participation in community politics. \n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI believe that any School Division Board should have a knowledgeable and varied representation, as varied and diverse as the community they represent. \nI believe my many years of experience as Registered Psychiatric Nurse, a successful advocate, and my vast involvement and understanding of Board governance are well suited for the role of School Board Trustee. \nMy knowledge of the health care system(s) and social services within Winnipeg and within Manitoba would be a definite asset to the St. James-Assiniboia School Board.  \n\nI will work hard to improve our school system and fight for the rights of all students, families and residents of St. James-Assiniboia School Division. To ensure that students will graduate from a high quality, accessible, publically funded school system.

Having taught in St. James for 33 yrs. and substituted in all of the city of Winnipeg school divisions for the last 4 years since retirement, I have an intimate knowledge of what happens in classrooms.  I have taught at every level from Kindergarten to Grade 12 (Senior 4) while substituting.  All three of my daughters went through from K – Grade 12 in St. James, which gives me a parent’s perspective of our system.

I have recently completed my PhD in Educational Administration, which was a very demanding and time-consuming endeavour. With this degree completed, and with working only part-time on my other professional duties, I have the flexibility and time to offer in order to serve as a school trustee.          \nAnother reason that I chose to put my name forward is because several of our experienced trustees on the St. James-Assiniboia School Board are not running in this election. I believe that with my extensive experience in the field of education, I have the ability to help fill the gap left by these educational leaders. Two of the retiring trustees, Bruce Alexander and Peter Carney, have endorsed me as a candidate, which is an honour because I admire the work they have done on behalf of the students, families, and schools in our area.\nFinally, I chose to run in this election because I have the support of neighbours, acquaintances, and professional colleagues who believe that I have the skills and experience to serve our schools and community.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nThe experience I bring is three-fold. First, I am a life-long resident of St. James, and therefore I understand the community, its schools, and its residents. I lived in this community as a child and attended school in Deer Lodge. Now, my husband and I are raising our children in the same community, and they, too, are attending schools here. This is the second area in which I bring experience, as I view the needs of the school system through the eyes of a parent. I am strongly committed to ensuring that all children are provided with every opportunity to meet their potential academically, and to develop the skills of good citizenship. I believe that being a parent of school-aged children will give me a distinct outlook as a school trustee. Finally, I am an educator by profession. I have been a classroom teacher and resource teacher, as well as a consultant and principal. Now, at the University of Manitoba, I train students to become teacher. This experience provides me with the knowledge to better understand the needs of students and schools.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nIf I have the privilege of serving as School Trustee for the Deer Lodge/King Edward Ward of the St. James-Assiniboia School Division, I make the following commitments to the citizens of our community:\n\n* Support all students in meeting their potential through effective educational programs, including academics, the arts, athletics, trades programs, and special education.  \n* Seek ways to serve an increasingly diverse community population.  \n* Promote lifelong learning for students, staff, and community members.  \n* Encourage connections between schools and the community, through continued use of school facilities for family centres, child care, recreation programs, and community organizations. \n* Keep the needs of the students and community first. In the role of a trustee, the word “trust” must be maintained as the focus of the job. The needs of students and the community must always stay at the forefront of decision-making.\n* Maintain fair and equitable school taxes.\n* Ensure open and honest communication with residents of the community. I am committed to being accessible to all members of the St. James-Assiniboia community in order to answer questions, discuss issues, and resolve concerns.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI am not running as a candidate for School Trustee because I have one burning issue, or one dispute with our local school system. On the contrary, I believe that students in St. James-Assiniboia are privileged with exemplary schools and teaching staff. I also believe that our residents are fortunate, in that taxpayers in this Division pay the lowest school taxes in this city. This successful balance must be maintained in order to meet the needs of both students and taxpayers. This is the reason I am a school trustee candidate - to maintain and enhance an already effective school system.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI welcome interested people to contact me if they have any questions about my campaign or about the schools in St. James-Assiniboia.

I graduated from St. James Collegiate and both my children graduated from John Taylor Collegiate. Both children went on to become teachers due in no small part to the input and impact of their teachers. Now I have two granddaughters attending elementary school in Westwood. I want them to have the same great experiences that their parents and grandparents have had. So I believe it is my turn to give back to the community and specifically the school division that has had such a great impact on my family. With the retirement of some long-term trustees there is an opportunity to bring fresh eyes to see opportunities, fresh ears to hear from all the stakeholders in the division and a fresh voice to speak on behalf all the constituents of St. James-Assiniboia.  \n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nMy experience and expertise are in the area of board governance. I understand the role of a trustee as being one who is entrusted with the educational resources of a community and with the responsibility to steward those resources as diligently and wisely as possible.  Currently I am an independent consultant that facilitates not-for-profit organizations in their governance processes as well as assist boards in relating effectively to management. \n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nSchool boards, taxpayers and service providers, including employees must always keep in mind that the same dollar cannot be spent twice. Once a decision is made to spend a dollar in a certain way that is one less dollar that can be spent on something else.\n\nThe major issues requiring significant board attention over the next few years are:\n\n* Aging school buildings:  As school buildings get older, more money will need to be allocated to the maintenance and upgrading of facilities. We do not want schools that are perceived to be rundown and outdated. \n* Lifting the moratorium on school closures: When this occurs the School Board will be required to once again address the issue of school closures. Schools that are significantly underutilized can affect class sizes and the effective use of educational dollars. Trustees must avoid the temptation of parochial decisions rather than taking into account the impact that closing or keeping a school open has on all the residents of the school division. \n\nI will not be a trustee who seeks to advance a personal agenda or a pet theme. My stand will be based on the combined interests of all stakeholders in the division. \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\n* To see St. James-Assiniboia as a community where people will want to live because of the reputation of great schools with a reasonable educational tax rate\n* To provide an environment where quality teachers see St. James-Assiniboia as a great place to teach \n* To ensure that our schools are technically progressive and cutting-edge as well as physically state-of-the-art\n* To insist on strong leadership that is driven by careful consideration of the input of everyone in the community. \n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nA trustee must be open to listening to every stakeholder in the community. Then he or she must be willing to engage in knowledgeable and robust debate while at the same time considering the input and opinions of other trustees. While the board is a group of individuals, it must operate as a single entity with the best interests of all stakeholders in balance. \n\nMy experience in working with teams and boards qualifies me to contribute effectively to the board process. Effective board governance will facilitate an environment where students at all scholastic levels are empowered to graduate with the confidence that they can succeed in whatever endeavours they pursue.

I was a member of the Parent Council at Lakewood Elementary for six years.  For many years I volunteered Friday evenings to chaperone the pre-teen and teen dances at the Assiniboia-West Community Centre, as well as volunteer duties at many different events held at the community club.  My daughter sings in the St. James Divisional Senior Choir and I have chaperoned multiple choir field trips and events.  I have been the fundraising co-chair for the St. James-Assiniboia Divisional Choirs for three years.  I held positions of President, Secretary and Treasurer on the board of directors of Winnipeg Condominium Corporation #1 (Birch Park Condos) for 15 years.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nI am passionate in the belief that our children need to feel safe while at school and should want to be at school.  There must be a broad range of programs offered to our students including the arts, sports and special education.  It is vitally important that our children are provided with the best options available.  Our children must be properly prepared to transition into the world after they graduate from our high schools.  These are major issues that have been discussed with constituents in my ward.  \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI am a candidate for school trustee and currently unable to answer that question.  All the needs and issues must be discussed prior to a decision.  \n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI grew up Crestview and live in St. Charles.  My parents and sister also still live in the area.  I attended Buchanan Elementary, Hedges Middle School and John Taylor Collegiate (graduated in 1981).  My daughter attended Lakewood Elementary, Hedges Middle School and is currently attending John Taylor Collegiate.  I have been married 25 years to Grant Lethbridge.

Karen and I have been married for almost 28 years and from the start of our marriage we have involved ourselves in community and charitable organizations and then after having our children we also spent a great deal of time volunteering in their schools, band and choir programs and sports teams.  I have been asked why I have chosen to run for Trustee now that my children have graduated and moved on to university.  I actually found that question to be a bit odd.  Do we only become involved or offer assistance when there is something in it for us?  That is certainly not my view.  When our daughter Samantha and son Justin were young and attending school, my time was spent simply trying to be the best Dad I could be.  I think I have learned a few things along the way and I would like to continue giving back to this terrific community as a School Trustee.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI have spent most of my adult life employed by the Province of Manitoba.  For the last 14 years I have been in an administrative position which provides me with the opportunity to work on many committees and projects.  I have developed some of the skills necessary to navigate the often cumbersome system of government.  As well, my duties include researching best practices in other jurisdictions and adapting those to work in the Manitoba environment.  Our schools must remain progressive and I would like to use my skills to do the research necessary to determine what innovative things are working well elsewhere and bring some of those ideas home to implement in our School Division.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\n* I believe budgets must be more closely examined and questioned.  With declining school enrolments and an aging population in our Division, raising school taxes cannot be the only remedy to balancing the books.\n* I would like to complete a review of the purchasing practices of the Division to make certain we are getting maximum benefit from each dollar spent.  I work in the procurement field and therefore I am confident I have the skills to undertake this review.\n* I believe our School Board must be transparent in all aspects of what it does.  If a parent or resident has an issue or concern which is important to them, the Board must be straight up when responding and openly provide the information they are seeking.  There is no place for “secrets” on an elected and publicly funded board.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI would like to see an innovative, exciting and rewarding education environment which is talked about around the province and one which attracts the brightest educators and families looking for the best public education system available to their children.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI feel I can bring a fresh approach to the way the Board does business.  As an elected member of the Board I will recognize that I am accountable to students, parents, staff, taxpayers and the community as a whole.  I believe the Board must never allow itself to become stale and must strive to have our Division remain on the cutting edge and always be relevant.  In order to encourage our students to remain in school and to do their best to positively impact their world, we must provide the opportunities, programs and incentives which encourage this.  Our children must always feel significant and never marginalized or be permitted to “fall through the cracks”.\n\n \n\nI will consider it a privilege if the residents of Kirkfield/St. Charles choose me to represent them on the Board of the St. James-Assiniboia School Division.

I have spent nearly half my life as an educator seeing the benefits and opportunities an education can give to our youth. I value and believe that our public education system provides equal access to all, and gives everyone opportunities to succeed in our society.\nAs a contributing team member, I feel that my background and experiences can add to the strength of our board. \n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI will bring many experiences to compliment my role as a school trustee. I have been an educator for over 20 years. I have been a classroom teacher, curriculum consultant, and school trustee. I have three daughters in the public school system. Presently, I have a daughter in elementary, a daughter in middle school, and another daughter in high school; so I feel that I have a good understanding of the situation in our classrooms. I am involved with our community and speak with many other parents, educators and community members, so I feel I can be a strong advocate for our community.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nI believe in a strong local school board. A local school board can provide the best experience for students that reflect the unique characteristics of our community. As school board members, we live in the community and understand what is important to our parents, children and other community members. A strong local school board can provide for these local choices. One such example in St. James – Assiniboia is that 70% of our students from grades k – 12 participate in the performing arts. With this high interest, our local school board can provide resources and programs to address this need. These resources and programs may not be available otherwise. Other programs such as French Immersion, Early Childhood education, and Special Needs education although not uniquely found in St. James – Assiniboia can have unique characteristics that reflect our local character.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nOver the years, there has been a shift towards driving our children to school instead of having them walk to school. With the fear for their safety, this has been a sign of the times. Along with this increase in vehicle traffic around our schools during student pick up and drop off, the risk of accidents to our children is increasing. To help lower this risk of accidents, I would first like to see a program or way for our students to safety walk to school once again. If students must be driven to school, I would like to see safer drop offs and pick up locations. This will not only provide for a safer environment for our children, but will help ease the congestion of traffic around our schools. Our school board has already begun to address this issue, but needs to get more resources to address this issue quicker. I don’t know if more or better drop off/pickup loops are the answer to this situation, but it needs the partnership of not only the community but the municipal and provincial governments as well to address this problem.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI believe that our schools must not only prepare our children to succeed in our society but must also be able to compete globally. Our country is changing quickly. One of the major changes is our shift away from the manufacturing sector to a more service based economy. If we are to grow and prosper as a country, we must continue to be innovators. I believe that our schools must enhance our student’s experiences in the areas of math, science and technology. In the early 1990s, I can recall hearing that by 2010, about 95% of the skills needed in the work force will require math, science and technology skills and attitudes. I find it difficult to think of many jobs that do not require these skills and attitudes. With our need to address the problems associated with our environment, health and future energy needs, we as a society must not only concentrate on literacy, but must become scientifically literate as well. To compete and prosper on a global stage, we must be innovators. This goal of becoming innovators must start at our local school system","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":60,"electoral_race_id":13,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.051-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.051-05:00"},{"id":60,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":61,"electoral_race_id":13,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.059-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.059-05:00"},{"id":61,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":62,"electoral_race_id":13,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.068-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.068-05:00"},{"id":62,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":63,"electoral_race_id":13,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.076-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.076-05:00"},{"id":99,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nI was first elected to the board in 2006.

I want to be ACTIVE, ACCESSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE to all of the citizens in the ward in order to address the great infrastructural challenges, the need for more youth activiities and resources, and in my opinion the need to develop and grow the emerging technical skills among young people that are currently living in the ward, specifically in the area of internet security and cyber defence.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nI have been very fortunate to serve 2 terms as School Trustee in the Winnipeg School Division.

Thanks to excellent administrators, teachers and support staff, the Winnipeg School Division has the ability to advance and continually transform itself. \n\nI strongly endorsed the Winnipeg School Division Board of Trustees Educational Priorities 2010 to 2013:\n\n* To strengthen instructional and assessment strategies for all students using all available resources including the integration of technology.\n* To improve academic and behaviour support services for students with special needs (in accordance with the Standards for Student Services).   \n* To strengthen and enhance Education for Sustainable Development initiatives that address environmental, social and economic issues worldwide.\n* To further improve school attendance and graduation rates through the exploration of additional programs and strategies. \n* In addition to these four priorities I will work toward adding a fifth priority: that the Winnipeg School Division and the Province of Manitoba work together to develop full day optional nursery and kindergarten programs.\n\nThe above priorities will provide deep-rooted benefits for our young people, our society and our world.     \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division?

In my experience, the best way to achieve this goal is to work in partnership with parents, teachers, students, school administrators and the community.\n\nI will continue to develop more sustainable and cost-effective business practices in the division, as I have done consistently in the past, enabling cost reductions and savings achieved to be redirected to the classroom.\n\nMy record is one of accountability.  Accountability continues to be an issue for our division and I am committed to being accountable; to our students by providing a learning environment where all students can realize their full potential; to our parents by providing a safe environment so your children get the education they deserve; to our teachers by providing the support and tools they need to educate our children; to all of our over 5,000 employees by providing and maintaining a respectful and productive workplace; and to our taxpayers by ensuring tax dollars are wisely invested to achieve the greatest benefit for our community.\n\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI would like to see changes to the following key issues:\n\t\n* Graduation Rates - We have to determine how we can support the children in our care who are struggling to graduate.  Current processes have to be reviewed and improved for populations of students with less success than others.  We are partnering with such groups as Pathways to Education Canada to enhance success rates and we always work in partnership with the many service agencies of the Provincial government as they support various at-risk students and their families.\n* Supporting the needs of immigrant children - We have a provincial government successfully utilizing immigration as an economic driver for the Province.  That is wonderful for our economy.  Many of the immigrant families reside in the Winnipeg School Division and we have a responsibility to ensure that their children are given the tools they need to ensure they will be net contributors to our society.  Of the immigrant population we serve, some of the students have never lived anywhere other than in a war-camp.  This necessitates some incremental investments in their transition.\n\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nThere are a few other issues I would like to deal with if my candidacy as a school trustee is successful.  \n\nEnsuring adequate Succession Planning for the Division:\n\n* We have a responsibility to adequately plan for the succession needs of the division.  \n* Lack of such planning could result in costly future errors.\n* I believe that we need to enhance our approach to succession planning.  We need to ensure that we transfer the vast store of knowledge of our retiring employees to the next generation of employees.\n\nProvincial Bargaining:\n\n* Provincial bargaining is an opportunity for significant administrative cost saving in every school division province-wide and significant cost saving for the Manitoba Association of School Boards. \n* The Manitoba Teacher’s Society is on the record supporting provincial bargaining.  We currently have 37 School Divisions in the Province conducting their own negotiations.  All settlements result in roughly similar results province-wide given the possibility of arbitration.  Manitoba taxpayers would be well served with just one negotiation process and this would happen if all school divisions listen to the Manitoba Teacher’s Society and support provincial bargaining.

From there I moved on to other issues I felt were important like getting junk food out of school vending machines. Most of all working on how to graduate students ready to meet the world and its challenges. \n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI am experienced as a mother, with children who have graduated from the Winnipeg School Division.  I am very proud of the division  and in my business career I was exposed to countries without a public school system. The countries are weak and their children are unable to reach their true potential. My business experience included problem solving, collaborating and teaching  in order to solve problems.  These skills helped me build the Manitoba Theatre for Young People at the Forks  and other challenges in my volunteer life not just my business life. \n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nThe major issue I stand for is educating children from the time they are born until they reach their goals in the  their choice of careers.  I believe we need  someplace mothers can go with their young  children to socialize and support other children and mothers preferably in schools when possible. I want to see daycares and nursery schools with educational opportunities so children  are prepared for Kindergarten and Grade 1. I would like to see support for all children before school, after school whenever it  is possible to make sure they have a level playing field to start school and that they always access help when it is needed.  This is the only way to make our society strong and our children successful.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI think the Winnipeg School Division  provides many programs to help children get the necessary education but we can always improve.

I believe  we should continually be monitoring and improving all programs and training our staff to be even better at their tasks.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nIn the school budget for 2010  while I was chair of the school board we sustained programs and services for students and kept the education property tax levy at the 2009 level through expenditure reductions further cost control measures, accessing the provincial tax incentive grant and the use of reserve funds.

They have informed me about their concerns for safety, cleanliness and the loss of housing. These things affect student enrolments and link to local health. Seeing new arrivals to Canada in Central Park and at IRCOM Housing down the street from my home, I know that schools in the inner city face the steep challenge of integrating children from diverse cultural backgrounds and helping aboriginal children succeed. \n\nMany schools in our wards play a critical role in future economic well-being of inner city families and ultimately of our city: we have a moral duty not to overlook inner city children and children who have special needs. I also want to see the important role of schools and health of children taken into account in neighbourhood planning because this is part of that obligation.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nFor 20 years, I have worked in a volunteer capacity because of the ongoing loss of inner city housing.

As the Chair of the Social Services Appeal Board, I understand board governance and can advocate for changes in provincial legislation.  \n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nStudent Voice  – I put forward the recommendation to create the Student Advisory Committee which brings together youth from all high schools in the division so that they can express their views to the trustees. I believe that youth need a voice in the decision making process.\n\nEnsuring Safe Learning Environments in Schools - My plan for human rights training in the school division has made our schools safer for students, and a healthier workplace for teachers and support staff.\n \nManaging tax dollars responsibly – I have supported and voted in favour of small, incremental tax increases to maintain necessary programs and services for students.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nOne area that I believe needs changing is the size of the wards in the Winnipeg School Division.  I support a smaller number of wards.  Smaller wards would allow schools and local communities to have stronger connections to their trustee representatives, and make running for office to become a school trustee a much more accessible process.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI have twelve years of experience as an elected school trustee and am passionate about public education.  I will continue to work to improve our system and fight for the right of all students to receive high quality education and graduate from an adequately funded school system.  I have a proven track record and the conviction to get things done.","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":84,"electoral_race_id":17,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.349-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.349-05:00"},{"id":107,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nI am an incumbent trustee in Ward Three of the Louis Riel School Division. An experienced Board works closely with parents and the community. This respectful collaboration ensures that our students receive a quality education from the Louis Riel School Division. For example, our French Immersion Program is renowned throughout this continent, our Information, Communication and Technology Department has earned recognition and received prestigious awards from Micro-Soft and our English as an Additional Language and transitioning programs for refugee and immigrant children is heralded throughout Winnipeg. This EAL Program, administered by Tim McKay, provides our young newcomers the potential to become contributing citizens rather than turning to crime and gangs because of poor language and communication skills.  The sustainability of these and many other programs, and new initiatives such as a technical vocational middle years immersion school, are the reasons I am running for the office of school trustee.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nMy career has been diversified as will be our students. I have been employed as a flight operations for Delta Airlines, an entrepreneur in the retail grocery business, and finally a teaching principal instructing students from grades 5 to 12 in a multi-age, grade, level, and English as an Additional Language, educational setting. Lifelong learning and self-directed learning skills are crucial for the success of our students in this constantly changing and competitive world. \nAs a trustee in the Louis Riel School Division, I have served on many committees. Presently I am chair of the Technical Vocational Education Committee. In addition, I have served on the Winnipeg Technical College Board for years. I strongly feel that students must have access to technical vocational programs to engage in meaningful learning thereby maximizing their opportunities in the work world.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nThis Division is well governed and maintained. However, there is always room for improvement. The main role of any school division is to develop literacy and numeric programs with high expectations. I would like to see students’ work or evidence of learning to confirm that these divisional and provincial expectations are being met. I would like to expand our EAL program to include support for parents in their struggle to enhance their language skills and independence. Our increasing Aboriginal student population requires programming to connect and harmonize school and culture; graduation is critical to independence. Early learning and Child Care in our schools must be addressed. Early learning successfully prepares toddlers for Kindergarten and the shortage of licensed day care facilities are a major concern for our working and very busy parents. \nFinally, I would like to initiate a middle year's technical vocational school whereby students in grades six to eight spend a full semester introduced to vocational education: apprenticeship programs, and vocational opportunities/careers that are offered at Winnipeg Technical College and the Louis Riel Arts and Technology Centre at the High School level.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI would like to see more collaboration with the community including budgetary discussions. How can we accomplish this? The Board has tried many approaches but it has not been successful. We need to hear from all voices in the community to determine need. Our student voice is strong but I would like to hear feedback from our student population regarding day to day issues in their schools.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nIf you want a lawn sign or need any clarification, please call:\n253-1961 or e-mail me at:\nsarnia@mts.net\n\nThank you for reading ","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":108,"electoral_race_id":22,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.651-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.651-05:00"},{"id":108,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nI was motivated by a desire to give back to my community beyond what I had been doing as an active member of school parent advisory councils. In addition, as a parent of children in public schools in Ward 3, I was concerned that the important perspective of parents was lacking on the current board.\n\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI have been a member of parent advisory councils for 10 years, including 6 in executive positions, 3 of them as Chair. This required leadership and organization, patience, the ability to work as part of a group that sometimes had competing goals, respecting the limitations of what we could accomplish in a given time frame, making decisions based on what was best for the school community, being accountable and fiscally responsible, remaining goal oriented and task focused, working with deadlines, and respecting the rules and procedures in place.\n\nDuring my time as a PAC member we have organized school community BBQs, movie nights, \u0026 French Cultural events in the school; helped finance purchases of a school sign, a new scoreboard, microwaves, and projectors; we committed to donating money for students involved in school leadership and supporting their post-secondary goals; and we have added a new playground, and began a greening project which has so far seen the addition of 12 trees, 3 picnic tables, and an outdoor classroom on school grounds. In addition, we have reviewed countless policy documents as they were developed by the school board, and attended many consultation evenings.\n\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nI believe there needs to be more effort put into parent and community contact and consultation, as a way for ideas and information to be shared. Every day there are media reports of students dealing with physical and emotional traumas in schools and on playgrounds, so I also stand for ensuring safe, respectful, and secure schools. I support a request initiated by parents of the College Jeanne-Sauvé community for the construction of a facility for performing arts, as another way to nurture and develop student talent. Finally, I stand for the responsible\n\nand appropriate spending and allocation of resources; human, financial, and otherwise as we all work together to build strong public schools.\n\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nGiven the role of technology in our lives, and the way it impacts our relationships with people, I would like to see all schools in the Division fully embrace any and all opportunities to have students learn with technology, while still respecting the critical importance and value of direct human communication. I will also encourage environmental initiatives, at both the division and school levels, and support partnerships with foundations, such as Evergreen, that will allow students to introduce and drive sustainable development in their schools and their community.\n\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\n\nI have been regularly attending Louis Riel School board meetings since January of this year. In addition to meeting all of the members of the school board, I have had the opportunity to become familiar with how the meetings are run, the procedures and protocols involved, and the roles and expectations of school trustees at board meetings. With this already in place, I can immediately begin to focus on the task at hand, namely the needs of students, teachers, parents, and our entire community.","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":109,"electoral_race_id":22,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.661-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.661-05:00"},{"id":109,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":110,"electoral_race_id":23,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.677-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.677-05:00"},{"id":371,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":294,"electoral_race_id":60,"created_at":"2014-09-19T00:56:20.194-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-19T00:56:20.194-05:00"},{"id":278,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI was inspired to run in LRSD by my children. As a parent, I understand and I am a strong believer in the value of the public education system. I care deeply about the quality of education received by all students and want to ensure a positive education experience is provided to all. I believe that for our children to develop socially, physically and mentally they must be provided a safe, inclusive and positive environment in which to learn. I want to be part of shaping this education environment with the support of the community. \r\n\r\nWith new challenges on the horizon – provincial funding, 20K-3 initiative, new school in Sage Creek to name a few - it is important to bring a new voice and fresh ideas to the table. We can’t continue to rely on ‘typewriter’ methods in a ‘smartphone’ world. We must continue to move our education system forward using new technology and advances so we don't continue to lag behind. The solution lies within each school board and their mandates to the education professionals that teach our students.\r\n\r\nI would be honoured to be able to carry your voice as a school trustee. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nThe most important experience I can bring is being a parent. Having children attending school in the division, I am able to see first-hand the challenges they face and the rewards they get out of our school system. I understand the challenges of juggling outside priorities with school. I understand the challenges with child care in schools, I understand transportation issues for schools, I understand school supply shopping, I understand challenges in engaging the community…..I understand. I want to work together with the board to address all these and more.\r\n\r\nAs a professional and leader, I work daily with a diverse group of people. I have vast experience in building and working with successful, dynamic teams. I have built and set budgets, outlined and managed performance, recognized process improvements and worked to better the experience of both staff and members of the community we serve. I currently serve as Director with the Credit Union Managers Association of Manitoba. I'm also an active participant in the Credit Union Young Leaders Association of Manitoba. I have a B.A. degree from Brandon University and a Certificate in Management from the University of Winnipeg. \r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nStudent safety. A schools geographical location or what road it is on or how close it is to a middle years school or a high school, or how high the grade level of the school is, should not be overriding factors to student safety. There is an opportunity for LRSD to be a leader by creating 30KM/h limits in all school zones regardless of the schools location or circumstance.\r\n\r\nA vibrate, successful school system starts with community engagement. Reporting back to the community, creating feedback loops to better understand the community needs, meeting with educators regularly to get feedback are all areas of importance. Setting standards for trustees to attend Parent Council and School Council meetings, not waiting to be invited, taking initiative and reaching out to these groups and arranging attendance. Find ways to involve the community in the decision making process - invite residents into board processes through various opportunities for committee involvement.\r\n\r\nInvest in our education professionals. I want to ensure that all those people that form a part of our students education experience continue to grow and learn as professionals. Ensuring that their development aligns with student needs. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nDiversity. It means so many things, but in our ward, we have diverse families and schools with needs that are changing and evolving. As a school board, we need to make sure that we continue to provide opportunities for our community to thrive. With 40 schools, and close to 15,500 students and teachers, we need to ensure that we provide a safe, inclusive environment that develops the social, mental and physical capacity of our students. \r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal we need to make sure we have strong measures in place to direct the education of our students. We need to find ways to better track and recognize the successes and failures in our schools. When we fail we need to be accountable, take responsibility, learn from it and put standards in place to keep it from repeating. When we succeed we need to recognize success, shout it from the rooftop, and teach everyone how to also be successful.\r\n\r\nI want LRSD to do more than say the words in their mission and vision statement, but rather, live these statements in everything they do. That these statements are used to shape the foundation of policy creation.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nWe continue to face challenges with our education system. Our community needs someone that is going to face these challenges and represent the views of the community in a fair, safe, professional manner. I want to act as a conduit between the members of our community and LRSD to ensure that we are not missing opportunities to be better. \r\n\r\nWith two new communities about to start being built in our ward - precinct J and precinct K we need to start considering the long term impacts of these developments. Many families in our ward will be impacted and we need to start to manage those expectations. Over the next few years we have an opportunity to be proactive in managing our impact on these developments instead of being reactive after the fact. \r\n\r\nI invite you to follow my campaign on social media - Twitter using @Justin4Trustee, Facebook using www.facebook.com/justinfortrustee, E-mail using Justin4Trustee@yahoo.ca and on my website at www.justin4trustee.wix.com/justin \r\n\r\nThank you for your support and your continued support of our strong public school system!\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":246,"electoral_race_id":68,"created_at":"2014-09-13T00:55:24.717-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-30T21:35:06.431-05:00"},{"id":274,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI have two children attending school in the division, and going through the educational process with them has given me a new appreciation for both what has worked well and what could be improved on in terms of how curriculum is delivered, and how we can better prepare our children for the world they will enter. I might have stayed on the sidelines were it not for comments from some trustees about how the position is a 'stepping stone' to some greater political office, or how some would like to impose their personal beliefs on the broad spectrum of diversity that attends public school in the division. Those comments reminded me of the importance of taking part in the political process not just as a voter, but if necessary as an active candidate as well. We all want our children to enter the world prepared, confident, and equipped to deal with what they will face, it is the common purpose of all parents.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nAs a parent with two children going through the division right now, I have a certain level of personal experience in dealing with the administration, especially in terms of how the Division approaches the provision of services to special needs children. That being said, I believe the role of trustee is as the voice and advocate for the community, and as someone who has worked in customer facing management roles with two of Canada's largest corporations, I have a wealth of experience when it comes to advocacy, dealing with difficult circumstances, and insuring that solutions to complex situations are approached with the interests of all sides in mind. I also have over a decade of educational background in Cultural Anthropology, which has taught me that while our schools and communities are local, solutions to some of the challenges we face today can be found in a variety of cultures and across the globe.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI believe that the role of technology in the classroom needs to be given a more prominent role than it has. Our children will be going out into a world where even the most basic, entry level jobs and community roles require a basic degree of technical aptitude. I believe technology can be used to provide more transparency in the decision making process, and will be advocating for the full record of all school board meetings to be archived and maintained for public access, except in so far as material is legally sensitive (for security and HR reasons). We are elected as Trustees not because we are in some way more knowledgeable than the public we represent, and the public has a right to know how we are representing them. \r\n\r\nI also believe we need to take a firm stand against the promotion of any religion within the public schools. Religious education is the role of the parent or religious leader, not the school. Public Schools are to prepare children of multiple backgrounds, faiths and cultures for a bright future within Canada, not to recruit new members of a particular faith.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThe Louis Riel School Division is incredibly diverse and filled with young families who want the best for their children. I want to bring forward the best those families have to offer the community, celebrate the diversity they represent, and make sure that their concerns are addressed quickly, with compassion, and to build a better future for the School Division.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":244,"electoral_race_id":67,"created_at":"2014-09-13T00:27:16.660-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-30T22:38:18.499-05:00"},{"id":292,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI am passionate about public education. I have been a public school educator form the Philippines for 10 years and continiued my teaching carrer here in Manitoba for 26 years..\r\nMy experiences from a classroom teacher to an administrator gave me some insights as to what can I do to help my community.  My children went to public schools in the Seven Oaks SchoolDivision. At present my two grandchildren are in the  Seven Oaks Schools as well. As a citizen of the country  I have the rights and priviledges to contribute and to help effect changes in the  operation of public school system to meet the needs of our children who are the future citizens of the  country.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI am very well versed with  the governance of a school board. I bring a wealth of experiences in terms of collaborative and cooperative process  in order to effect decision making.\r\nFor the past 6 years as Trustee in Seven Oaks School Division, I have been involved in different  CHALLENGING comiittees such as: SOTA Negotiations, Professional Development,of staff, Joint Board and SOTA .Advisory Council, Sustainability , Heriatge Languages and others.\r\nBeing the Vice- President of the Manitoba School Board Association I am knowledgeable on how school trustees concerns and priorities of the province such as :\r\nMental health, Aboriginal Education, poverty and  just diversity, and equity\r\n\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nBuilding capacity to strengthen community relationship is very crucial because Seven Oaks is a highly diverse ethnic community. We have to reach out the newly immigrant s, Aboriginals to establish Treaty relationships, \r\nOur intergenarational community are a strong source of experiences that can be shared to both older,seniors and students.

I'm not taking donation from business people or from unions — and I never will. \r\n\r\nI'm running for office for the same reason you would: because I think I can help make this city better for the people who live here. \r\n\r\nMy priorities are the same ones that I've heard from my neighbours while knocking on doors all over my ward. People want to live in a Winnipeg that is fair, that is kind, that is awesome. But a single councillor is only one vote. So I'm not just a guy with a few ideas and solid ideals. I'm also someone who can listen to others and work with them to accomplish as much as possible, together. \r\n\r\nYou're not just electing me to fix the problems faced by the city right now, but to face the challenges that still lay ahead.I'll be the best councillor not because I have all the answers, but because I'll be the best at finding them.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nOver the years I have sat on many boards and been a member of multiple committees. I have experience dealing with executive councils and The Board of Governors at Brandon University. I understand the process and rules that are in place during these meetings and those in place at City Council meetings. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nWinnipeg needs a bold plan to build homes for every homeless person in Winnipeg. This is possible. The state of Utah has done this and reduced it's homeless rate by 74% in the last 8 years.\r\n\r\nThe city could provide a simple internet service for free or offer higher speeds at a reduced rate to help lower income families gain internet access.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Policy Committee is not democratic. We elected these officials to their councillor positions, not to the E.P.C. They are picked by the Mayor, which can breed corruption.\r\n\r\nI would like to explore a corporate income tax in Winnipeg and lower property taxes.\r\n\r\nStop paying companies to move to Winnipeg with tax incentives. Instead use that money to support \u0026 expand local businesses.\r\n\r\nI suggest that all ward allowances be pulled \u0026 if money is needed, it must be requested during council meetings.\r\n\r\nBring all Water \u0026 Waste infrastructure up to date. Remove all combined systems, so that we are not sending our sewer waste straight into the Assiniboine \u0026 Red River.\r\n\r\nWith the increase in severe thunderstorms in Southern Manitoba, including Winnipeg, now is the time for us to build a Severe Weather Early Warning System.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nI have come to love the St. Charles area. There are no large buildings obstructing my view of the skyline and plenty of parks and opens space for my son and I to enjoy.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am not just a representative, I am a resident.

Our ward has experienced a lot of change in the last four years, I would like to use what I have learned and apply it to the next four years.  The role of school trustee is a very fulfilling job.  Pembina Trails is made up extremely talented and loving people that share one common goal, to provide quality education to our children and support them as they develop into confident, caring adults.  I am inspired by our schools every day and I want to continue to be part of a team that supports our children and the community they live in. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI have gained valuable experience in the last four years as a trustee in ward 3.  I am chair of the Building, Property and Transportation committee and past chair of the Pembina Trails Educational Support Fund.  I have been a member of the Education committee, the Communications committee and the Finance committee.  I am a current governing board member for Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology (formerly Winnipeg Technical College).  I am a provincial trustee representative for a Manitoba School Boards Association committee.  I completed an intensive coaching program which I received a certificate in the iPEC educational leadership program - coach centric leadership for education professionals.  I am very involved in the community and I volunteer in various roles: President of Richmond Kings Nursery School, Treasurer to Sparks unit 351st, Preteen Dance Coordinator at Richmond Kings Community Centre, a member of the Fort Garry Community Network, a member of the Fort Garry Healthy Together Now Grant selection committee and a volunteer at the Mid-Winter Festival at Acadia Jr. High and will be committee chair in 2015.  \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nThe school division needs to have a strong voice in the community.  I consistently advocate for community consultation and follow up regarding any changes to current and future programming.\r\nThe Province of Manitoba has mandated a cap of 20 children per classroom from Kindergarten to grade 3.  I feel it is important to maintain lower numbers of children in grade 4 classrooms as well because they are still early years learners.\r\nOur division is planning to build 5 new schools over the next 15-20 years.  I support long term financial planning for the division to balance the costs of maintaining its current programming with the addition of new schools.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nIn 2010 the Board of Trustees implemented their three expectations for student learning: All students will be engaged in their learning, all students will be meeting provincial curricular standards in literacy and numeracy and all students will graduate.  These have served as a north star for schools to set goals and collect data to track progress.  The division's 21st century learning belief statement also supports these expectations.  I want to continue the work that has been done on developing the three expectations.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nIt has been an honour to represent my community as a trustee in Pembina Trails; I truly love my job and the people I work with.

I am also seeking re-election to ensure the divisional priorities for student learning in LRSD remain relevant and measurable.  I'd like to see government mandated programs and initiatives funded at their real cost to school divisions.  No one would dispute the value of reducing class sizes from kindergarten to grade 3 to 20 students, but millions of dollars will be spent by LRSD alone to pay for the costs associated with this directive, which has impacted our budget and the taxes our community pays.  Finally, I am running to advocate for the important and necessary work of school boards and school trustees, and continued efforts to create the community partnerships that will not only strengthen public education, but broaden and enhance the programs, resources and supports we will continue to offer students and families. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nAs a parent, I continue to offer a perspective that I felt was lacking on the board up until the 2010 election, but which has been significantly enhanced since that time with the election of 3 trustees with children in LRSD schools. I've chaired all board standing committees and have a solid understanding of board policy and practice, as well as an appreciation of the role of trustees as governors of their school division. I have thoroughly enjoyed visiting all of our schools, which has allowed me to meet and get to know students, parents, staff and school administrators, as well as gain an appreciation of the unique culture, climate and needs of each school. The experience I bring is that of a current trustee fully immersed in, engaged in, and committed to, an elected position I understand, enjoy, and consider vitally important in the community. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n As a current trustee running for re-election I stand for (in no particular order): \r\n\r\n•\tprotecting visual and performing arts, band, choir, and music programs, and supporting opportunities for students to share and celebrate their talents in these areas;\r\n\r\n•\t policies, programs, and decisions that ensure LRSD schools and buildings remain safe, inviting, welcoming, non-judgmental, barrier, bias, and stereotype free learning and working environments;\r\n\r\n•\t supporting our students and families living in poverty, and those who are newcomers to Canada; \r\n\r\n•\tbroad and innovative uses of social media and technology in schools and classrooms to promote the acquisition of digital literacy skills, to support and enhance learning and teaching, and to provide opportunities for engagement with our parents and families both near and far; \r\n\r\n•\tongoing and relevant professional development for all LRSD staff; \r\n\r\n•\tregular contact with all members of our community to share ideas, gather feedback, inform our decisions and to simply talk about public education, community values and the future of LRSD.\r\n\r\nThis is not a complete list by any means. Several of these particular issues regularly come up in conversation with the community I represent, making them important to me and important to mention. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThis past year we had to solve the negative pressures that some serious overcrowding was putting on two of our french immersion program schools in ward 3. Every school based forum was extremely well attended by parents who were concerned how proposed changes might affect their family. It was an emotional time for many, and I remain appreciative of the participation of literally hundreds of parents, and their willingness, desire, and commitment to being part of the process from the very begining. This is what community looks like; people coming together to understand, talk, share, collaborate, and work together. As a result of this process, I see more of this advocacy around some new conversations in our schools, and, I see students starting to demand to be heard which is nothing short of terrific.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nMy sincere thanks to all of the students, parents, teachers, staff, administrators, board office staff, trustee colleagues in LRSD, Manitoba, and Canada who I have met and spoken with over the last 4+ years.  Your willingness to engage in conversation and debate has allowed me to better understand the current and emerging issues and challenges facing public education from multiple important perspectives, which has made me a more effective, engaged, and enlightened trustee. \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":109,"electoral_race_id":67,"created_at":"2014-09-11T00:11:39.252-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-05T18:32:16.617-05:00"},{"id":84,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nI decided to run after seeing many issues in a school my three children were going to!

I was a member of the original development committee for the School Resource Officer Program.\n* Safety should include working with our children on strategies that promote anti-racism, that enable greater understanding of diversity, the benefits of mutual respect and the responsibility we all have for ensuring a safe and just society.\n \nIncreased Parental Involvement\n\n* The families of our children are our greatest asset. Studies prove over and over that the strongest indicator of student success is parental engagement. Parental involvement needs to continue to be a top priority for the division.\n \nStronger Academic Achievement\n\n* I believe that improving academic achievement must continue to be a focus for the Division. As such I have called for the creation of a sub-committee of the board that will look at strategies such as extended learning time to improve academic outcomes and increase graduation rates.\n* High quality education requires highly trained and motivated staff. I support the enhancement of professional development.\n* Ensuring enhanced learning opportunities for all children cannot be overlooked. Examples such as Children of the Earth Medical Program must be made available if we are to produce leaders of tomorrow.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\n* I would like to find ways to increase graduation rates and general levels of competence at graduation. We want to keep our students in school and provide them with the tools they need to be successful in their next stage of life whether in work, college or university.\n\n* We need to find more equitable ways to fund public schools.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nThroughout my career, as a School Trustee in the Winnipeg School Division, through my employment in a variety of youth serving organizations, in the many community volunteer positions I have held and most importantly as a mother, I have always tried to recognize and respond to individual differences.  There are many road blocks within our society that impede the progress of children as they grow and develop.  These challenges are widely spoken of in the media and in our daily life.  Socio-economic issues such as poverty, addictions, violence, lack of appreciation of cultural diversity, gang pressures and much more all play a part in limiting positive outcomes.  As a society we must recognize the pressure these issues place on our students’ potential development.  Through the position of Trustee, I have been able to help bring more children through these challenges, with the goal of brighter futures.

I feel I can offer a perspective not yet seen as I am intimately acquainted with the issues from the perspective of a student (who graduated from the Winnipeg School Division), a scholar (who investigates the acculturation concerns of immigrant families and youth), and a community leader (who works in constant consultation with parents, students, and teachers).\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\n* I continue to live in the same neighbourhood where I graduated from both Machray Elementary and St. John’s High schools. I also completed a Bachelors of Arts (Honours) at the University of Winnipeg and Masters of Arts at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My love for learning is deep rooted in my experiences as a student of the Winnipeg School Division. I am committed to give back to the community that has attributed to my academic accomplishments.\n* I am a founding member of Aksyon Ng Ating Kabataan (ANAK) Inc. a youth-based non-profit that builds partnerships with students, families, teachers, and scholars to provide educational resources, mentorship and scholarships to immigrant youth.\n* I am the curator of Manitoba’s first Filipino-Canadian oral history project and exhibit at the Manitoba Museum; and coordinator of Canada’s first accredited Philippine Studies Course at the University of Winnipeg. These innovative projects attest to my investment in diversifying education so that it is inclusive of all peoples and cultures.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nThe major issues I hope to stand for are the ones I have learned from students, parents, and teachers. These include:\n\n* Community – Our schools need to reflect the learning that also takes place outside of the conventional classroom. Students (especially immigrant youth) are often left to navigate differing cultural perspectives taught in class and at home. I have learned that families and community groups can help students through this process with mentorship, language, and after-school activities with the right encouragement. These supports are far more reaching and meaningful to students because it builds relations and greater multicultural understanding.\n* Safety – To ensure our schools remain a positive learning environment free from negative pressure.\n* Resources – To carefully understand the budget so that resources are managed carefully and fairly. I am disheartened to learn some accelerated programs are no longer offered at the high school level due to low enrollment. I fear that this will limit the potential of those children who wish to take part but cannot.\n* Opportunity – To ensure all students are given a chance to realize their full potential through meaningful activities (including sports, arts, music, employment, volunteering)\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division?

In my employment field I am an active member of the companies’ workplace safety committee, and have participated in CME yellow belt training so I believe I bring a different perspective to the board should the citizens of ward 3 choose to vote for me.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nAdult or mature student diploma programs, this division current policy is a hindrance to the economical challenged working class (and YES, I am in that class). The current policy of ONLY daytime adult education is unacceptable to any one working a day shift hours of operation who want to improve them selves. I decided to run in 2006 for the same reason and choose not to actively pursue donations to advertise and was happy with the vote count, this time around I am still not asking for donations or advertising in an forum that requires payment( as this is a limitation due to my own financial situation) . My goal this time around is to double the number of votes with and perhaps that will be enough to be privileged to hold a seat on the board.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division?

In all wards.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nOther thoughts, practical and cost effective use of school facilities with open borders policy mandated by the provincial educational authority and moratorium on school closures. Does this division make cost effective use of facilities? With the real estate board  wanting school tax taken off property tax rate payer( yes some incumbent will tell you school tax portion has been reduce on your tax bills however it is not reflective of the existing boards tax measures but the province increasing home owners education tax credit), the school division as well as other divisions have an opportunity to ensure rate payers get the most value for the tax dollar spent, some schools have daycare centres in them as an example are these centres (which are not owned and operated by division) paying fair market value for space? Are there opportunities to have other services in the schools?

All of my children have attended school in the division and my youngest two, as well as my grandson are still attending school in Ward 3 of the Winnipeg School Division.  I am also a life long resident and a taxpayer in the ward.  I believe I have a combination of experience, skills, knowledge and a strong independent voice required to deal with the issues facing the public school system today.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI have served on the Board of Trustees for the Winnipeg School Division since 1995, when I was first elected.   As the senior trustee I am presently the longest serving trustee on the Winnipeg School Division's board. My 15 years of experience provides the board with  an insight as to how division policies evolved, as well as what may have or has not worked in the past.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nI stand for the major issues and concerns that are important to the people in my ward.  I believe they should have a voice in the decision making.\n\n* The school division needs to find alternative resources to assist in funding public education other than raising school taxes, therefore I initiated a Revenue Raising Committee which has worked on that issue. \n* A few years ago, before it became such a news headline, I raised the issue with regards to child obesity and what role the school division should have in addressing this growing problem.  This is still important to me.\n* In the financial spectrum, province wide collective bargaining and school division amalgamations are issues which should be addressed and could help keep our taxes down. These issues are important to people in my ward.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI definitely would like the Winnipeg School Division to be more transparent and open.  I believe the public and taxpayer have a right to know what is going on for the many issues that the board moves to \"in camera\" sessions. \"In camera\" means \"behind closed doors\" where the public is not allowed access to information.  This is a public school division, funded by public dollars and the public should have access to a lot more information on a lot more of the important issues.  It's my personal belief and practice to provide the public with as much information as possible.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI am proud to have served as a school trustee for 15 years, and would be honored to continue.  One of my strongest beliefs is to be accountable to the people in my ward.  Their concerns are important to me and I believe they should have a voice in the decision making.  I am not afraid to speak up for issues that are important to my community and are important to our children's future","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":91,"electoral_race_id":18,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.424-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.424-05:00"},{"id":91,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":92,"electoral_race_id":19,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.446-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.446-05:00"},{"id":92,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 school board election?** \n\nI am not the type of person to sit on the sidelines and complain. Whether it was working for a school gym, helping to organize a new Novice girls' hockey league, or working for a charity I believe in, I prefer to take action and initiate change. I am not afraid of hard work and long hours and get great satisfaction from working hard to achieve worthwhile objectives. \n\nAs a parent and a volunteer I have worked hard for the best interests of not only my children, but all the students of Queenston School. As a Trustee, I can continue doing that for all the students in the Ward.\n\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nMy main experience with the school system started six years ago when I joined the Queenston School Community Gym Committee. I worked with a committed group of volunteers to lobby all levels of government of varying political stripe for a gym for the school. The doors are scheduled to open September 2013, and I am so proud of the work we did. \n\nThat experience was important because I learned how to work within the school system to get things done. The work included navigating administrative and political hurdles which required patience and persistence, while at the same time we had to listen to the parents, students and staff of the school. It was a balancing act that gave me the experience I think is important for a Trustee to have.\n\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\n\nNo matter what the issue, we need to make decisions within the school system based on the best choices for our children. There are five issues I believe will be important in the next several years:\n\n* ACCOUNTABILITY – Creating accountability for our students (do we continue with no fail/no deadlines approach?) and for our system (standardized testing) generates passionate debate, and need to be revisited.\n* ATTENDANCE AND GRADUATION RATES – We have to strike a balance of programming, parental involvement and creating a sense of value for education within the child that we need to motivate.\n* SERVING THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS - Parents of children with special needs know their child the best and need to be a full partner in the education of their child.\n* COMMUNITY FACILITIES – With infrastructure renewal underway in both schools and community centres there are opportunities for both the school and community club to explore developing facilities that can serve both organizations. \n* SCHOOL DIVISION BOUNDARY REVIEW – While the organization of school divisions is a provincial matter, every organization needs to ask itself once in awhile whether or not their structure is meeting the needs of those they serve. I fully support such a review. \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nThe school division raises as much money as the city (property taxes and school taxes are almost the same amount), but education issues and the School Board Trustee elections do not get a lot of attention. At the door, those without children tell me that they do not vote in these elections because they do not have kids in the system, though children who have a quality education tend to become contributing citizens and most often stay out of trouble. \n\nBy better communication and hard work on important issues, I hope to work towards raising the awareness of these issues, and increasing the engagement of the people of Ward 1 in the important issues around education. We spend a lot of money on our education system and the outcome is so important, I believe that it deserves more attention than it gets.\n\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI have always derived great satisfaction from the work I have done in the community, and I look forward to working hard for the students and the residents of the Ward.\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":93,"electoral_race_id":19,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.454-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.454-05:00"},{"id":93,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 school board election?** \n\nThe personal reason I decided to run was concern over the state of the public school system.  I have three children, two of them at Ward 1 schools with a 3rd one joining them next year.  I am a strong believer in public schools as a foundation for a functional democracy.  I am concerned that the system is underfunded and starting to break down.    The School Board expenditures are rising faster than its revenue increases and as a result the  School system has been hit with a series of incremental cuts, mostly affecting capital and infrastructure.   Parent advisory committees have stepped in to fill the funding gap which has created disparities between wealthy and modest school communities.  While some schools are building brand new play structures and putting IPads into the hands of their students other schools don't even have proper gyms or changing room facilities.  The system of funding is not sustainable and it is attacking the universality of the public school system.\n\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI am Lawyer and businessperson having been the founding and managing partner of my law firm.  I have experience dealing with budgets in the millions of dollars and supervising staff.  In addition I am a Deputy Chief Residential Tenancies Commissioner for the Province of Manitoba and have experience working in government.  I believe in education and have been involved as a lecturer/instructor in the professional education of other lawyers as well as coaching 7 \u0026 8 year olds as part of the Crescentwood Grizzlies Football program.  I come from a family of teachers and understand the stresses and difficulties they face in doing their job.\n\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nThe current funding model is not sustainable and a review must occur with all three levels of government to address the funding shortfall.  More money needs to be put back into the schools to upgrade the infrastructure and make the buildings more environmentally sustainable.  We need to invest in technology and science equipment to ensure that the teachers have the most current teaching tools necessary.\n \nTraffic is a severe problem in Ward 1 schools and there is no transportation policy to deal with congestion in residential neighbourhoods during peak times of the school day.  Alternatives like the \"walking school bus\" have to be promoted and expanded to reduce the impact of cars in the neighbourhood to make the school safer and greener.\n \nThere is no connection between citizens and their school trustee.  Ward 1 has 19 schools and over 25,000 households a trustee cannot reasonable connect with a ward of that size.  There needs to be major electoral reform to create smaller ward sizes to allow a trustee to have a personal connection with their community.  Further, there is no campaign finance rules in place and no limits to spending or disclosure of donors.   This has to change.\n\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nCurrently, the Winnipeg School Division pays for the maintenance and upkeep of the old Sir John Franklin school yard.  The Division cannot afford to continue to pay for land no longer used as a school but  the residents need to keep the property as a park.  I support that need.  I would advocate on behalf of residents to have the City of Winnipeg purchase the property from the School Division but only on the condition that it be rezoned as park land and maintained as green space.\n\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI will be a strong advocate for teachers, student and parents within the School Division.  I believe that with proper funding that Winnipeg 1 School Division can become a model for other divisions in the Province.  I want to reward innovative teaching methods and ensure that our schools are diverse, vibrant, safe and environmentally responsible communities. \n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":94,"electoral_race_id":19,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.463-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.463-05:00"},{"id":94,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 school board election?** \n\nHi, I am your Nassau Street neighbour/taxpayer for 17 years.\nI would be honoured to be your School Trustee.

I wanted the next Trustee to be a parent who cares for the children of the Division, who believes in the power of public education to improve the community, and who feels that the students and teachers in our Division are best served when stewarded by someone who has first hand experience with the way that public schools work, and who has a non-self-serving interest in making them better. In an absence of these qualities in so many of the individuals who run for Trustee positions just to be politicians, I found, as I'm sure that you will, that the person who best personifies them is me, Gerrit Theule.\n\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nAs I mentioned in the previous question, I am currently the Chair of my son's Parent Advisory Council at, I believe, the largest elementary school in the Province, Ecole Laura Secord School, where I have led a diverse group of parents in our Division through many difficult challenges over the past two years. Here, I have had the privilege to be involved in the process of re-drawing of our school's boundaries to accommodate an ever-growing student population in limited classroom space, ensuring that all of our parent's concerns were heard. More recently, I acted as the parent representative and liaison when there was a fire at the school last month. Administratively, I have assisted with the boards of two arts organizations as well as having sat on the board of the Don Quixote Housing Co-op. Within the division, my experience goes as far back as being a student representative to the Winnipeg School District's South End Advisory Committee while attending Grant Park High School. My long history in this area and with this Division speak strongly to my commitment and experience in this neighbourhood and to my knowledge and understanding of the issues that the Board faces every day.\n\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nI think that parents are crying out to have someone speak for them about the Comprehensive Assessment Program. This ill-planned program takes away valuable teacher time, interrupting learning in our classes and costing vast sums of money when substitutes fill in for them. C.A.P. tells us nothing and doesn't give us any data to act on. Teachers, parents, and taxpayer groups are all standing against this: it's time that someone listened to them.\n \nI would like to see an increase in drug and alcohol awareness programs at school. When looking at it as a safety issue, very few of our students will see a weapon brought into school but virtually all of them will face these kinds of pressures that concern me far more as a parent.\n \nThird, I would like to see our board increase graduation rates by starting to help children as young as is possible. Every study out there tells us that the earlier that we help kids, the more likely they are to graduate and the less crime we will have in this city. Don’t want your car stolen? Elect someone who will follow the research and initiate programs to help kids out early and often.\n\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI think that our School Division needs to be run more on ideas and proven research and less on ideology. When the Division makes decisions based on fear and politics the children, and ultimately society, pay the price.\n \nThe Comprehensive Assessment Program would be the first thing that I would like to see eliminated. It costs vast amounts of money and doesn’t tell us anything at all that the teachers don't already know about our students.\n \nI would like to see our teachers have a better method of providing feedback about Division policies since they are, after all, the ones seeing first hand the immediate effects of the decisions made.\n \nI would also make an effort to change the ways in which Trustees interact with their Wards. I would guess that a significant number of people who live in the Ward are unable to name their three Trustees. I would like our Trustees to be more accessible and more accountable to the people whose lives they are affecting on a daily basis.\n\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\n\nOnly that if you are looking for another Trustee to be an MP in five years time, I'm not it. I will be a Trustee who feels that this position is an important enough one to stick with, and who didn’t get into the process as a result of shopping for a public office. I will be a Trustee whose only vested interest here is in improving things for my children as well as yours: I have no professional affiliation with education and nothing at stake in our public schools besides the best interests of our children. Finally, I have a long history with the Division and this neighbourhood: From elementary school in the Division to Grant Park High School to chairing a Division Parent Advisory Council, from playing and later volunteering for Crescentwood Grizzlies football to meeting my wife for the first time right here on these very streets, I love it here and only want to see this area, and this area's children, thrive. Ask yourself on November 26th if there is anyone else who would be better suited to be your Trustee. I think that you’ll find that I am the best choice.

My students, who are mostly refugees, inspire me by their faith in education as a way to succeed in society and become productive citizens. I feel I owe it to them, to students throughout Winnipeg, and to their families, to bring my passion for schooling to the Winnipeg School Board. \n\nWhile my devotion to public education is important to my decision to run in the upcoming by-election, perhaps my biggest motivation comes the teaching of my parents, who have instilled in me a love of being active in my community. Teachers themselves, they've always taught me to work hard for the things in which I believe. I see the potential of students every day. I know there is more we can do as a community to improve our schools. I am willing to do whatever is asked of me by my community to make the Winnipeg School Division the best it can possibly be.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI am the only education professional running in this election. That brings a body of experience that provides me with unique perspective. I have worked in Winnipeg schools for the past 8 years as part of my education at the UofW. I completed my B.Ed. in 2010, which provides me with a current academic foundation. I have met numerous other teachers, many of whom I consider good friends. I have seen many different classrooms, different grades, different schools, teaching a whole host of different subjects. I am aware of all parts of the school system throughout Winnipeg.\n\nMy passion for education has led me to explore other opportunities in the education field. I have worked for alternative education programs such as Community School Investigators, Career Trek and the Selkirk Healing Center. I served as president of the Education Students Association, where we had one of our most successful years ever. I have also tutored at the Global Welcome Center at the University of Winnipeg. Currently, I sit on the Advisory Council of Safe Schools Manitoba, where I help guide policies that ensure safety in Manitoban schools. I hope I can continue my hard work at the school board level.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nThere are many issues that affect schools in the Winnipeg School Division. As a School Board Trustee in Ward 1, I will work continuously to make sure the issues that matter most to my community are represented in School Board meetings. My main focus is bringing forward the concerns of others to the table. I will work with the teachers to make sure they are given the resources and training to do their jobs. I will meet with politicians at the provincial level to make sure they understand their commitments to provide the required funding and resources to maintain a high level of instruction in Manitoba classrooms. I will bring together parents, business leaders and school administrators to communicate with each other to ensure our schools are community-minded. I will work with Universities and Colleges to ensure they are providing high quality teacher training to future teachers. Essentially, I want all issues discussed openly with all stake-holders and with the best interests of the students in mind.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nDuring the past month, as I've traveled around the ward, meeting with community members, I've encountered a lot of positivity about schooling in the area. I am not someone who is aiming to make sweeping changes or reforms. I don't believe we need to be scrapping current, effective educational practices, or digging up old, out-dated practices like standardized testing that are expensive, proven to fail, and based on tired ideology rather than research. I believe that we have made great progress over the past decade in delivering quality education in our schools and I would like to build on that success. I believe in the path our division has set and I will sit with my fellow trustees as an ally in their efforts. The only thing I might change is the minds of the few who believe that our schools are not effectively delivering quality education. Vote for me, and I will devote myself to sharing the many successes of our students to help change those minds!\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nOn November 26th, vote for someone who lives, breathes and bleeds public education. Vote for someone with new ideas backed by education and experience. Vote for a candidate with energy, dedication, and devotion; someone looking to work with others to bring even higher levels of success to our schools. \n\nI am so pleased to have met so many concerned citizens on the campaign trial over the last month, and I would be greatly honoured to have the opportunity to meet more of my constituents as the newly elected School Board Trustee in Ward 1.

I have an RN Diploma, BA advanced degree in Labour and Workplace Studies and a Masters in Health Services Management.  Through my years of work in Labour Relations, I am a skilled negotiator, advisor and consultant.   My skills related to employment matters will assist the Board related to decisions of that nature.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to my education and professional skills, I have served on several Boards as a Public Representative and have recently been appointed to the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority Board of Directors.   I am experienced in making decisions related to program delivery and budgets.  Further, I am committed to continuing to finding ways to deliver programs and services in a cost effective manner.\r\n\r\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\r\n\r\nI would like to improve services to new Canadians and Immigrant families across the division.  Winnipeg is a city that celebrates its multi-cultural makeup.   I believe that with the help of senior administration, teachers, parents and students that we can continue to improve those services.  New Canadians experience tremendous stressors and I believe together we can improve the transition in order to assist students to become productive and positive members of our communities.\r\n\r\nLastly, I will commit to pursue the ongoing discussion of size of the school wards in WSD.  Currently, the size of Ward 3 is larger than a Federal Riding.  This matter deserves further discussion and information gathering at the Board level.

I'm directly in touch with the needs of my community and I have a special interest in the mental health and healthy body image of children and youth. The education system can play a critical role in nurturing the development of children's self-confidence, emotional strength, problem-solving skills and other factors that influence mental health; that perspective needs to be represented at the board and I look forward to creative engagement with educators and families on these issues. My primary roles throughout my career have been as a counsellor and health educator with youth.  I have also been an advocate for social change.  Systemic change is required to address the social problems and inequities that contribute to individual issues.  After years of working with youth and families, I am ready to contribute to sustaining  a strong and healthy public school system in which children and youth from all backgrounds can reach their full potential.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nA trustee needs to think critically about a wide range of issues, listen to the needs of a diverse range of people, and make tough decisions that best represent the needs of the community.  The experience and skills that I bring to the role of trustee are more important than my stance on any specific current issue.  You can read my detailed biography at my website www.lisanaylor.ca  and a brief summary follows:\r\n\r\n* I am a professional communicator. Central to my work is listening to people's problems and communicating effectively with others.\r\n*  I participate in ongoing education  to help me be respectful and competent in my communications with people whose culture or life experiences differ from my own.\r\n* I use consultation and research to make well informed decisions.\r\n* I work to consensus while not being afraid to stand alone on important issues. I am direct and articulate when challenging the popular opinion and asking tough questions.\r\n*  I excel at problem-solving, mediation, and decision making and have experience with facilitation, supervision, and evaluation.\r\n*  I have extensive experience with committee work at the local, provincial and national level and have served on other Boards of Directors.  \r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n* Appropriate specialized education programming for students with exceptional and special needs ensures that all children can reach their full potential.\r\n* Music, arts, physical education and cultural activities complement and enhance academic learning. \r\n* Aboriginal perspectives should be integrated into all aspects of educational endeavors to support cultural competency and increase respect for Aboriginal culture and historical heritage.\r\n* Newcomer students and their families require effective support and programs to ensure they have an equitable chance for success. \r\n* Schools need to be body-friendly environments where people of all shapes and sizes are included and respected.  \r\n* Board information, business practices and decision-making processes should be visible, easily accessible, accountable and open to participation.\r\n* Trustees must be committed to community engagement. A school board and its schools are intricately linked to the lives of families, to the local community, to the province and to the larger global community.\r\n* School administrators need  to engage in pro-active outreach to specific communities that are not currently well represented on parent councils, committees or present at school events.\r\n* Professional development should be provided to all staff members to strengthen cultural sensitivity and increase teacher-parent liaison skills\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThe diversity of Winnipeg School Division students presents many challenges yet it is our greatest strength.  20% of WSD students identify English as an additional language and approximately 23% of families with school age children in the division are Aboriginal.  Many of our students bring lived experience from all over the globe and study side by side with children from families who have lived in Winnipeg for generations.  Efforts are made for inclusive education opportunities for children with varying abilities and learning challenges. This diversity can be respected and capitalized upon in order to help students  develop the skills of empathy, respect for difference, and community responsibility. \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nAs your trustee, I will bring the fresh perspective and the passionate energy of someone who is new to civic leadership while also bringing 25 years of experience and demonstrated skills as an advocate, leader, thoughtful decision maker and skilled communicator.   \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":266,"electoral_race_id":72,"created_at":"2014-09-14T03:33:46.213-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-29T15:43:11.467-05:00"},{"id":313,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nAfter 3 years on the Board I have gotten a good picture of what needs to be changed in the Winnipeg School Division (WSD).  The Division has an achievement gap between students from wealthy households and those struggling with poverty.  I believe the School Board can do more to close this gap and ensure all students can be successful in our education system.  To that end, in my first term I was able to start a full-day nursery/full-day kindergarten pilot program.  We placed this program into four of our lowest socio-economic schools. Often in these school, students fall behind and never catch up with other students in the division.  The added time with trained teachers in the nursery and kindergarten program has dramatic results in helping these students catch up to other students in the WSD.  We are monitoring this program closely and if successful, my priority is to expand the program to other schools in the division on a \"need\" basis.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI have been on the Board of Trustees since my by-election win in 2011.  I have been elected vice-chair of the Winnipeg School Division for the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 School years.  I have been a member of the Finance Committee, French Language Advisory Committee, South End Advisory Committee, Must Fund Committee of MSBA, Winnipeg Teacher's Association Committee, and the Ward Boundaries Review Committee.\r\n\r\nI am a lawyer by career and own and operate a 10 lawyer law firm where I am the managing partner.  I have handled million dollar budgets in the private sector as well as managing 15 employees.  At the WSD I help administer  a 374 million dollar budget.  \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI am committed to closing the achievement gap between students of differing socio-economic backgrounds.  I am committed to the expansion of Full Day Nursery/ Full Day Kindergarten programs.  \r\n\r\nI am committed to prioritizing funding for the arts, science and math education.  I want to continue to reform how the Division conducts math instruction in the early years and see that the WSD becomes a leader in this area.  I am interested in expanding enrichment programs in the WSD including creating an IB program for the middle years.  I would also like to see the WSD develop a junior and senior high Arts Academy where students can receive special training in theatre, music, film, graphic and classical arts.\r\n\r\nI am committed to making the WSD more environmentally sustainable.  I would like to develop an active transportation policy and create a division wide \"walking school bus\" program.  I want to continue with our energy retrofits of our aging buildings and the continual upgrading of our water lines to allow more water bottle refilling stations in our schools.\r\n\r\nI am committed to lobbying  the government to increase funding to schools to ease the burden on property taxpayers.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nMy ward is diverse.  With the neighbourhoods of Earl Grey, Fort Rouge, Crescentwood and North River Heights the needs and expectations of the citizens are varied.  Each neighbourhood has its own concerns and challenges and special care needs to be given to address each communities priorities.  \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI believe in an education system that enhances democracy, builds citizenship and develops community in our youth.  I value diversity, inclusion, creativity, and rigorous academic standards.  All my decisions will have those values and goals in mind.\r\n\r\nI want to see students who are creative, who are engaged in critical thinking and who are socially responsible.  The policies that I will support and the initiatives I will create will have that as there focus.  \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":94,"electoral_race_id":71,"created_at":"2014-09-14T03:20:18.136-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-29T07:19:31.873-05:00"},{"id":311,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI have two children, 6 and 3 years old.

There are decisions that need to be made by a Board of Directors that is skilled, experienced and modern enough to make them. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI have been privileged enough to hold positions on the Board of Directors for Lord Roberts Community Centre for 5 years and Sustainable South Osborne Community Cooperative for almost 3 years, providing me with experience in board governance. I have organized community clean up events, sought and supported grant and private funding for programs and initiatives, and assisted in coordinating a Community Consultation between the City of Winnipeg and the Lord Roberts community on the topic of the Fort Rouge Railyard Development.\r\nI have worked for 13 years in the public health sector, 10 of which have been with one employer. \r\nI grew up in South Osborne and decided to raise my own family in South Osborne. I feel that my over 20 years of experience as a constituent, including attending area schools, provides me with a good understanding of the socio-economic needs and values of our constituents. \r\nI have experience volunteering with the Green Action Centre and Winnipeg Folk Fest and experience attending South End Advisory Committee Meetings as a High School Student Council President.\r\nI maintain good relationships with City Councillor Jenny Gerbasi and Minister of Education and Advanced Learning James Allum. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI will support the continued provision of an early education free Nursery program. Research has shown that preschoolers that are engaged in peer level social interactions and early exposure to reading and writing perform better in K-3. The school division has the means to make this programming accessible, efficient and cost effective for families.\r\nI will support the continued development of Outdoor Learning Spaces at our elementary schools. I will support educators' attendance in personal development, such as the Manitoba Nature Summit. I believe that children are dynamic learners and there is much to be learned from the natural environment.\r\nI will support a health curriculum that is informative, accessible, inclusive and age appropriate. \r\nI am concerned about the use of social media in high schools. I will promote the establishment of policy that protects the rights of students and educators to a safe educational experience, in its physical and online environments.\r\nI will promote a re-evaluation of school bus service and ride lengths. I believe we can do better than have children sit for 1 hr. rides to and from school.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThe Winnipeg School Division covers a wide range of socio-economic constituents. I believe that this lends itself to an educational experience celebrating diversity and inclusion. I wish to represent this belief in the division's policies and operations.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI welcome constituent conversation and have organized several Coffee Chat evenings open to the public, to meet me in person and discuss whatever questions or concerns are on their minds pertaining to the Winnipeg School Division, on October 2 at Lord Roberts Community Centre 7:30 - 9:00 p.m., October 7 at Lord Roberts Community Centre 7:30 - 9:00 p.m. and October 9 at River Osborne Community Centre 7:00 - 8:00 p.m.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":263,"electoral_race_id":70,"created_at":"2014-09-14T03:10:02.308-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-01T15:01:44.143-05:00"},{"id":318,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nThere were many things that compelled me to run for School Trustee, not the least of which was encouragement from several teachers, division staff, former Trustees, and neighbours to get more involved. I have a breadth of education and experience in governance and Board work, spend significant amount of time in classrooms as a volunteer presenter, and have a Master's Degree in non-profit management and public administration, which I feel would make me an ideal candidate on the Board at any time, but especially now when a full two-thirds of incumbents have chosen not to run again. \r\nThe Winnipeg School Division suffers from a very poor graduation rate, and while there are very complicated reasons behind this, I have the ability to relate to this as I was a high school dropout myself, after attending public school for most of my education and two years at a private school. I later entered university as a mature student, earning two degrees and rekindling my passion for education. \r\nFinally, beyond my qualifications for the role, I feel I could really help my community as a Trustee. I have built up a level of expertise and want to put it to good use!\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nExperience is among the most important attributes a candidate in this election must have, and believe that not only do I have by far the most experience, I also have the most relevant. Over the past 14 years I have sat on many committees and volunteer Boards including the Manitoba Eco-Network, the General Council of Winnipeg Community Centres, and the Manitoba Water Polo Association, among others. Currently I am on the Board of Assiniboine Credit Union, the largest credit union in Manitoba, the Sexuality Education Resource Centre, and the University of Winnipeg Alumni Council where I am President.\r\nI also have significant experience in classrooms. For nearly ten years I have been giving volunteer presentations to nearly every age group in schools around southern Manitoba on topics as diverse as blood donation on behalf of Canadian Blood Services, environmental stewardship and water conservation as part of my project the Water Conservation Challenge, and on human rights, volunteerism, and travel. I have visited hundreds of classrooms and spoken to more than 10,000 students. This front-line experience has helped me to be more aware of the evolving needs in classrooms and a better understanding of our school facilities. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nMy biggest priority as a School Trustee is to work with the Board to come up with and implement better ways to engage with the community and include them in the decision making process when feasible. Last year the Board voted to change the ward boundaries for the Winnipeg School Division but then did very little to inform the 150,000+ voters in the division of this substantial change to their democratic rights. The previous Board could have done a better job of reaching out to the public and they must in the future. \r\nI would also like t investigate how capital projects are prioritized and do a full fledged capital audit on all division buildings to give the Board an idea of rough life-spans for each school and administration building. Our capital funding should take the long view in terms of priorities. The division must also be more flexible in its approach to capital funding when opportunities arise. The Gordon Bell field is a good example of a time when the school board fought against a project that was a one-time opportunity for an inner-city school to have an outdoor field, merely because it wasn't in their capital plan.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThe Winnipeg School Division has exceptional teachers and has been a national leader in special needs education. Being both the largest division in the province, and providing schooling in one of the lowest-income areas in Canada and what may be the most ethnically diverse (certainly Ward 5 is one of the most diverse int he country) poses significant barriers and the division has been able to adapt to changes in student body quite effectively. I also think the Winnipeg School Division has made great strides in offering independence and autonomy to teachers to use alternative methods in the classrooms to support the students. \r\nMy area is awesome. While i did not grow up in Ward 5, i made the decision to purchase my first house at age 22 on Burnell St to be close to school (U of W) and to work. The area is amazingly diverse, with at least eight different languages spoken at home just on my block! It is close to everything and contains some of the best schools in Winnipeg. \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am not a teacher, nor am I in any way an expert on education. But I am an expert on Board processes, consensus-building, and active listening, three skills that I feel are absolutely essential to being an effective Trustee. I know how to get things done from a Board level, know how to read complicated financial statements, excel at critical thinking, and have lots of energy. And I am actively reaching out to the community in a way that no other candidate in the ward, and maybe the entire city is. By the end of the campaign I will personally have knocked on more than 4,000 doors, not just to drop off a flyer or to ask to put up a sign, but to actually listen to each person's concerns and needs. A School Trustee is both an elected representative and a Board member who must try and balance what is best for their constituents, what is best for the school division, and what is best for the students. I have the skills and experience needed, but also the youth and energy required to relate better to students and teachers and to follow through on my goals. \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":78,"electoral_race_id":73,"created_at":"2014-09-14T03:41:09.119-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-05T15:35:54.791-05:00"},{"id":277,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI am currently retired following a wonderful and satisfying career in the St. Boniface School Division.  My passion and desire to improve educational opportunities for our students\r\nkept me interested in our education system and with the encouragement of members of the local community, I decided to enter the elections for school trustee.  I strongly believe that education is the building block for our future and the future of our youth.  Communities and countries that do not have a strong public education system do not succeed and struggle to reach their full potential.  Maintaining and continually looking to improve the Louis Riel School Division is the driving force that motivates me to work for our community and the students within our schools.  We (the teachers, principals, superintendent's team, parents, community members, and the Board) have accomplished much in the Louis Riel School Division since the amalgamation of Norwood, St. Boniface, and St. Vital.  Our division is respected throughout the province for the manner in which it deals with difficult decisions, and the positive way we involve the community in our plans for the future.  I would love to be part of that future.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI first became an elementary teacher at Beliveau School.  My career led me from my grade 6 classroom to the position of  Supervisor of Physical Education.  During that time, St. Boniface became the first division in Manitoba to have a daily physical education program.   I later became the principal of Beliveau Junior High School, Pierre Radisson Collegiate, and Windsor Park Collegiate.  As a community member I was a coach in the Winakwa soccer program, the University of Winnipeg soccer program, and the Legion Track and Field Camps throughout the province and at the International Peace Gardens.  I served on the Operations board of the Pan American Games and was President of the Manitoba Track and Field Association and later, the president of the Manitoba Lacrosse Association.  I was a Board member of the Manitoba School Boards Association  as the vice-president and as a Director of suburban boards. Other boards include: the St. Boniface School Board, the Canadian Lacrosse Association,, and MANTRA [the Manitoba Tobacco Reduction Association].  I currently am president of the Manitoba Lacrosse Hall of Fame as well as a member of the of the Community Connections committee and the Negotiations committee of the Louis Riel School Division.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nOur world changes, and as it changes our division must be prepared to meet the needs of the children who live in our community. Example: We now have family centers to assist young mothers and fathers in preparing their children  for a successful entry into school life and we are also providing more vocational programs for high school students. I believe we have to put a strong emphasis on the teaching of literacy and numeracy.  That currently is one of our goals and everyone in the division, including parents, must work towards those goals and we need to follow up our actions with a reliable source of data that shows we have benefitted student learning.  I also strongly support creative arts programs, vocational programming, and school and community joint use programs.  Emphasis must also be given to programs and opportunities to prepare our youth to become contributing members of society.  We have to plan for the maximum development of each and every child. At this time we must also provide our students with the best technical resources possible.  We must ensure that we will provide a positive, and safe educational climate that allows for success in learning for all students.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nAs a principal, I have witnessed the completion of Windsor Park and the beginnings of Southdale.  As a trustee I have seen the birth of Island Lakes, Royalwood, Southland, and now Sage Creek.  I have watched them grow and weave them selves into really positive communities.  As it is with your community, It is the same for Boards. We all come from different wards and from different parts of the division.  However, our goal is to take responsibility for the entire division and ensure that all students have the best possible opportunity to learn and be successful.  We have to learn how to weave our selves into a team that can govern and lead our division in a positive direction.  That is easier said than done.   What I appreciate about our division is the willingness of trustees to work together for a common cause which benefits the students and the larger community.  We have disagreements and different views of the world.  However, we have learned that if we can't work as a team, negative things happen.  I appreciate team work and  I know that there is always something extra you can do to improve your skills.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nIf you talk to my colleagues, you will find out my passion for the importance of education in our society is still strongly motivating me to run again for the position of trustee in Louis Riel SD and I would like to represent you in Ward 4.  I am not running because I have one single cause I want to change.  I am not running because I have future dreams of being an MLA or MP.  I put my name forth because I am genuinely interested in the education of our youth.  I work part time at Red River College and so I have the time to visit schools and keep in touch with community groups and members.  My experiences are part of the skill set I bring to the position.\r\nI may be contacted at 204-253-8431 or 204-298-9249.

Being a graduate of Red River Collage and the University of Manitoba I will bring a business background to the board looking for cost savings on the operation side of the division, which can then be put back into the schools to benefit students and teachers. In addition, I was also part of the policy committee (chair), students liaison and negotiating committee of the teachers association of the SOSD.  During the years 2011-2012 I also served as vice-chair of the division and most recently served as chair from 2013-2014. Lastly, I am a member of the Purchasing Management Association of Canada and hold a professional designation (SCMP). \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nOne of my top priorities within the division is to have equitable funding for our schools, which will lessen the burden of taxation of home owners within the division. This issue is important to me because it will allow for more programs to be incorporated into our schools, which can range from the free lunch program, to the skate program all the way to our adult education program. Increasing the funding would ensure even more programs could be implicated within the schools providing teachers with more resources to develop children into bright and independent students. The second issue I would like to stand for as a trustee is ensuring that students at elementary schools are taught sufficient reading, math and writing skills, as those subjects are necessary to have continued success in the following school years and future careers. It is essential to have support and resources available for the teachers to address which students need assistance and provide them with the required help ensuring that the issue is taken care at a young age. This subject is important to me as I was a student who struggled in my early school years, however I received help from dedicated teacher. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nOne thing I particularly appreciate about the school division is the fact that it takes pride in welcoming new members, different ethnicities and the community at large. As a very diverse community, the division ensures cultural beliefs and traditions are preserved through a variety of language programs, workshops and community celebrations. The division takes pride in their multi-cultural students and staff who reflect the communities diversity.    \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI will donate my salary as School Trustee to your Parent Councils, as I genuinely care about the betterment of our schools. I have donated my annual School Trustee salary for the past eight years (two terms) and will continue to do so. This sizeable donation has provided monthly funding for library books throughout the Seven Oaks School Division. Both teachers and children participate in book buying to promote literacy in our schools. I respectfully ask for your continued support in this upcoming election as I am running to ensure the future generations of this community can be successful in whichever future endeavor they choose.   \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":73,"electoral_race_id":64,"created_at":"2014-09-14T02:25:32.876-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-07T12:54:19.162-05:00"},{"id":267,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nWith three experienced trustees not seeking re-election in 2014, as well as the passing of Trustee Shirley Timm-Rudolph last year, the time did not seem right to retire. Experience is very much required as the division is in the midst of a number of initiatives, including the 20K3 implementation, the grade nine integration at River East Collegiate, the automotive conversion into a performing arts music room, and the bus transportation facility review, and strategic planning, just to name a few. The division is also making changes in divisional communication strategy and senior succession planning. My years of experience will be invaluable, as new trustees come on board, and we work toward consensus.  \r\n\tI have much to contribute, as mentioned with my experience, passion and dedication. I have not missed a regularly scheduled board meeting in the past 10 years. Last year I had 15 requests to bring greeting at grade farewells and graduations, I was able to attend all but two. I support many sporting, musical and celebration events held in our schools. I devote my full-time attention to advocate for the children, parents and taxpayers of our school division.\r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nPeter’s School Board Experience\r\n•\tSince first elected, Peter has taken on the serious responsibilities of Board Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Board of Trustees. He has also served as chair or member of every standing committee, including Finance, Building and Property, Program and Policy, Negotiations, and Technology.  Peter also served on a number of Ad-hoc committees, including, Senior 1 Location Study, Board Strategic Planning and Senior Administrative Selection.\r\n•\tPeter has served as Provincial Regional Director on MSBA.\r\n•\tPeter is a past member of Provincial K-S4 Physical Education/Health Steering Committee.\r\n•\tPeter can identify with Senior Divisional Administrators, Principals and vice, Directors, many teachers, and many other important stakeholders within the system.\r\n•\tPeter is very familiar with all 42 schools, having visited them numerous times over the years, as well as the maintenance and transportation facilities and the off-campus areas.\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI stand for a safe, caring and nurturing environment, where children are encourages to excel. I strongly believe, every child deserves the opportunity to reach their potential, and use the experience gained as stepping stones to a brighter future. I include my home telephone number in my election brochures, because I feel taxpayers must be able to talk to their elected officials. I'm knows as someone who asks many questions, and always challenge those in a position to make positive moves, could it be done better, and never settle for \"good enough\". I expect constant improvements as we journey on. \r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nIf there is only one thing, I appreciate the warmth and sincere well wishes of the people of Ward 4. My ward is quite large, the ward boundaries run from Glenway  Avenue in the North, Kilcona Park to the South, Springfield Avenue to the south and the Red River to the West, with a little notch on Henderson Highway. I have walked my total area, and talking with as many people as I could, often hearing \"you are the only politician to have ever come to my door\", or folks greeting you at the door saying they will be supporting me before I even hand them my brochure, also hearing small children say to their moms and dads , \"this man always comes to my school\". Since I am asking the fine folks of North Kildonan for their support and vote, I feel strongly I should than also be the one coming to their door. The school children of my ward are the reason I do what I do.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nDear Neighbours,\r\n\tThe future holds many challenges and issues for education, and the public school system must provide educational opportunities for all children. As we struggle with declining enrollment in some schools, aging schools, limited resources and ever changing technology, we can never forget our citizens expect the best value and return for their  educational tax dollars.\r\n\tAs your full-time dedicated trustee, I pledge the River East Transcona School Division will continue to provide excellence in education from K to 12, with strong family values in a safe caring nurturing environment. I have the experience, passion, and dedication to ensure your children’s education interests are well represented. Nothing can be more important to our society than to ensure our children are well educated and prepared for the future.\r\n\tAs Board Chair, it has been an honour representing you, the people of River East. I truly enjoyed meeting so many of you during the various school graduation farewells, school sporting events or music/coral concerts to name a few. I also appreciate your phone calls and e-mails. \r\n\tI stand in support of public education. On October 22nd, I humbly ask for your support, confidence, and vote, for school trustee.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nPeter Kotyk \r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":42,"electoral_race_id":81,"created_at":"2014-09-12T01:09:35.651-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-10T00:35:01.852-05:00"},{"id":100,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 school board election?** \n\nI ran in the 2006 election and promised myself and the voters that I would run again if I was not elected.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nThe experiences that I have from business, raising three children ( 9 years as a stay-at-home Dad ) and general street smarts coupled with secondary education, makes for a unique perspective that has been lacking in the division.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nI believe that a student should not be advanced to the next grade if they have not developed the skills to complete the current grade.

In your ward?** \n\nThe first thing I would change is the school divisions' mission statement…suffice it to say that until all policies are reviewed we will not know why 50% of the students don’t graduate or are unprepared for a post-secondary education.\n\nThe mission statement is weak and it can't be measured for success. It also reeks of a political ideology that has no place in our schools.\n\nI would change the mission statement to include measurable goals such as  \"Graduate 100% of the students with fundamental skills in Reading, Writing, Math and Science\". The current mission statement seeks to develop responsible global citizens. After researching the genesis  of \"Global Citizens\" I studied \"Agenda 21\" from the 1992  U.N.

As a Louis Riel Trustee these past eight years, I have worked hard to ensure that our division is a diverse, supportive environment for children and learning. \n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI have served on the Louis Riel Board since the amalgamation of 2002.  During that time I have been Chair of the Board, Vice Chair, Finance Chair and Chair of Negotiations.  I sat on committees that conducted public consultations of the division wide lunch program and negotiated access agreements for the division’s changing role at Winnipeg Technical College.  I continue to serve provincially with the Manitoba School Boards Association Schools Insurance Committee (MSI) and have chaired that committee for the past four years.  Prior to my involvement with the Louis Riel School Division, I served in a variety of volunteer boards and positions including St. Boniface St. Vital Rotary Club, Jocelyn House fundraising and a Past President of the St. Vital Curling Club. \n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nMy campaign literature confirms that trustees need to actively engage community and work cooperatively to build on what has been a successful nurturing of our division and community of schools.  Sometimes the role of a trustee requires difficult decisions and the public deserves a trustee that can make those decisions with compassion and consideration of some widely divergent points of view.   To facilitate this I remain accessible and open to the broader community.  On more than one occasion, residents have felt very comfortable to walk in the door of my business office at 755 St. Mary’s Rd. and know that I have been here to listen to them.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nLouis Riel is a provincial leader in student service supports, French immersion, student evaluation \u0026 assessment and staff supports.  We need to continue to focus on policies and practices that put student education and achievement first while continuing to build classroom environments that recognize the incredible diversity of our community and also remain caring \u0026 supportive of all children.  All of the above was accomplished while not increasing our overall tax burden on the local homeowner, an accomplishment that we have maintained for the last three years.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank the residents of Ward 2 for their support over the last eight years.

I believe that our education system has the potential to nurture the gifts of students, teachers and educators so that we can have pride in who we are as a human beings and working citizens. We need to use our gifts whether we are a leader, skilled tradesman/tradeswomen, writer, mathematician, educator, counsellor, athlete, learner or teacher to install pride and hope in each other so that we can evolve into critical thinking and skilled working citizens. I would love to fulfill my duties and gifts by advocating and working on behalf of the community on the school board so that residents, students and employees involved in the Winnipeg School Division have their needs and gifts respected in our schools. I love my community and the dynamics, demographics and needs of Ward 5 are continually changing, as a School Board we need to be understanding of these changes and make informed decisions as school trustees.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI am Anishinaabe/Ininew and as a life long community member of the west end, I have shared and lived experiences with community members and students. I am a Greenway and Gordon Bell lifer, I can bring a youthful and well experienced community based voice to the table. As a former lacrosse player of Gordon Bell and as a lacrosse coach now I understand the importance of physical literacy and sports teams to schools. It is vitally important that students and educators not only focus on strengthening their mental capacity and understanding but also strengthening and maintaining their physical health. I am currently studying Urban and Inner City Studies, Religious Studies and Geography at the University of Winnipeg. The Urban and Inner-city Studies Department at the University of Winnipeg has and continues to equip me with valuable critical thinking skills and knowledge on the dynamics, issues and solutions to the inner-city of Winnipeg. The valuable knowledges and experiences gained in the UIC department are an asset in my candidacy for school trustee in Ward 5. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nHere are some of the issues and solutions that I stand for in my role as a School Trustee\r\n\r\n- Inclusive education for Aboriginal peoples, newcomers, special needs students, and gifted and talented students.\r\n- Further development of Aboriginal Language Program, in-school and after-school programming including transitional classrooms, off-campus programs, tutoring, and   mentorship initiatives.\r\n- Expansion of the role of student advisory committees at both a local and divisional level.\r\n- Establishment of a Student Leadership Centre to provide added supports and resources to young people.\r\n- Expansion of land-based education curriculum to encourage sustainable development knowledge and practice.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the school board recognizes the learning needs of each and every student. Expanding and being more inclusive of student bodies at the divisional level will strengthen and support decisions being made on the school board. \r\n\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":268,"electoral_race_id":73,"created_at":"2014-09-14T03:48:39.900-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-04T13:57:31.655-05:00"},{"id":299,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nThis past year I began to seek opportunities to get involved within our city, and months ago I began researching Trusteeship. Back when I was Student Council Co-President at Glenlawn Collegiate, I attended various board meetings pertaining to the divisional budget; it was in May when I began attending the public board meetings again, and I also started reaching out to several board members. I love new experiences, and this is the perfect opportunity to give back to the community that I currently reside in, and also grew up in. The experience thus far has truly been very positive, and I am looking forward to the opportunity to represent the residents of the Louis Riel School Division while making the best decisions for our current and future generations of students. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI am currently a second year student at the University of Manitoba, and along with my studies I am very active on campus. I sit on various committees and councils, and represent a very diverse population. I began taking on leadership roles in my elementary and junior high school days, and I continued to do so in my early high school days at Glenlawn Collegiate, I was involved in many extra-curriculars like Student Council, Youth in Philanthropy, and much more; in June 2013, I graduated as class Valedictorian. I kept the momentum going when I transitioned to post-secondary as in my second month of studies I ran for the position of Vice-President of the University 1 Student Council - a position and responsibility I still have today. I believe that if I were elected as School Trustee in Ward 1 of the Louis Riel School Division - I would bring a fresh perspective being a recent graduate from the division. Alongside my experience in school, I also have a lot of experience representing a wide-range of diverse individuals. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nSome of the issues I would advocate for if elected would be, increasing inclusiveness - continuing to promote equal opportunities for all of our students by advocating for safe schools, and also advancing the programs and services available for our students with disabilities and special needs. Furthermore, I would advocate to sustain our French Immersion Programs, as learning our national language is not only pertinent to our culture, but it would also be an asset to our students' education. The Louis Riel School Division has many programs and initiatives in place to ensure that every student has the tools needed to succeed, and the division does a tremendous amount of work to ensure that students feel safe inside their school - these initiatives are a part of what I would hope to sustain if elected into the school board. For more detail about some of the issues I mentioned, I encourage you to read my blog posts on my website www.nagra4lrsd.com. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nBeing a graduate from the Louis Riel School Division, I am very appreciative to many of the programs that the division has to offer. I am also very appreciative of the amazing educators and staff members that nurtured me through my K-12 education. I have so many positive memories and experiences from my K-12 schooling, and I am really hoping to give back to the division, and to the community that I grew up in.  \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am very pleased to have two of the current Louis Riel School Board Trustees supporting me, Trustee Gary Gervais from Ward 1 and Trustee Wayne Ruff from Ward 3.\r\n\r\n“Tanjit is an articulate, intelligent, and energetic individual. Having served as a Trustee for Ward 1 for 8 years and as Chair of the School Board from 2010 to 2012, I believe that Tanjit will make an excellent Trustee.

I have served as both Vice and Chairperson of the Board and have chaired all standing committees.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nBullying and Drugs are two of the main areas that school boards have to ensure that strong policies are in place for the protection of all students. Everyone is entitled to an education, school boards in the case of special need students have to make sure that there are the proper resources in place to assist each individual child.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division?

It's all about \"Children First and Children are our Future\" and everything else is secondary. School boards can still help that future as long as we maintain our focus on what children of all ages need to learn and thrive-no matter where they live. \n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nI have been elected by acclamation and look forward to the next 4 years serving the Louis Riel Community as a school trustee. School boards are comprised of citizens who invest significantly to ensure that the children in their communities are well served with programs and supports that respect unique local needs. We develop partnerships within our communities while we honour the values of stewardship.

It’s vital that our students are being engaged and learning at the highest level possible. As such, I believe educational accountability is a responsibility of school trustees and the boards they sit on. Taxpayers have a right to know how students are doing. Can they read, write and do math. Are they excelling emotionally, socially and physically? Trustees should be aware where students are at and set goals for higher student achievement. Overall progress must then be reviewed on a regular basis.\n\nAre students getting the best educational value for our hard earned tax dollars? I believe this question must be answered and revisited on regular basis. Taxpayers demand the most efficient use of public revenues.

As a trustee, I regularly asked many of the questions that parents and taxpayers would and should be asking of a school division. Tough questions must be posed on a regular basis on every single topic and issue. I brought my financial expertise as a Certified Financial Planner to the board table. I also brought my hat as a parent. I graduated from the division myself and my 2 sons did as recent as 2010. I have a nephew and a cousin in grade 4. I have sat on all committees of the school board and am able to participate immediately in crucial discussions on budget, negotiations and student achievement.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nEducational accountability is my primary issue. Student engagement and safety (emotional and physical) are vital to student achievement and enjoyment. If students feel safe and comfortable they have the foundation set for a successful learning career. We must do a much better job engaging all students and preparing them for the work force. Only 20% of students go on to post secondary education. Our technical and vocational courses must be more readily available at all schools. While ATC provides excellent programs, too many students choose not to attend simply because they do not want leave their friends and peers.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nWe need to improve accountability to our community, both in terms of educational and financial matters.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nIf  you would like someone who cares greatly about public education, has a proven track record for asking tough questions and demands financial accountability, then I ask for your support on November 26th.

I will never forget how frustrating and wrong it felt to have decisions made effecting my child’s education and school without having the right to be heard!  I will always work towards respecting our community and providing them with a satisfying mechanism to be heard.  I believe the business of educating our children is paramount.  I want to ensure that education remains a priority for our government.  The values that make young people gain confidence can start at home but are enhanced by good teachers and schools.  The public school system offers our children their first opportunity to be a part of a community of learners, and to venture into the world away from home.  As adults, it is our responsibility to ensure our children have the best environment for this learning to flourish.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI have a B.A. from the University of Winnipeg with a major in Developmental Psychology. For the past 3 years, I have been working as a casual Educational Assistant for LRSD.  I have worked in many classrooms across the division and each time I come away with an even stronger desire to support the important work that takes place in our schools.  Prior to this time, I worked for the University of Manitoba in in an academic administrative capacity.  I worked in Audit Services, the office of the Ombudsman and the Research Data Centres.  The governance and financial experience I have gained will serve me well in my responsibilities as a Trustee.   \n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nI believe that community schools are a meeting place and a place where relationships are strengthened. It is this connection to others, and the sense of mutual responsibility that these connections bring, that will promote a healthy social conscience in our children.  I am also firm in my belief that if we invest and focus on providing our children with solid literacy and numeracy tools in Kindergarten to grade 3, the remainder of their educational experience has a much greater chance of success.  Financial accountability is also very important to me.  People work very hard to support public education through their taxes, and I want to ensure them that I will make every effort to hold LRSD accountable for its spending. \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nTrustees work for the people in their community.  I will foster more consultation meetings regarding important policies or initiatives that affect all children.  I will also have a website where parents can inform themselves about decisions and policies that may affect their children.  We need to encourage the relationship between home and school. A strong trusting relationship between families, their schools and school division fosters a healthy learning environment for the children.  \n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nEducation is the best tool for breaking the cycle of poverty. Unfortunately, there is poverty in our community, and because of this, children suffer. I think we need to work together to address this, we need to listen to each other; and we need to listen to the world, because together we are stronger.  We will need that collective strength to get serious about preparing future generations to become leaders themselves.\n\nI promise I will work hard to be your voice.

The thing is, the bus transportation is not Mandatory.\n\nUnfortunately, the WPG public transit bus was full that morning and drove right by him. The division had no real back up plan – that is a Major Safety Issue. There are a lot of discrepancies as to what categories these kids do \u0026 do not fall under, according to the website.

This can involve reviews of anywhere from a couple of thousand dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars on a daily basis.\nI am a person of action, and in further support of my candidacy role - Several years ago, when I was a Customer Service Team Leader, with a local publishing co. for children's safety books, I singlehandedly shut down an inappropriate website after tracking down the domain company. Within 12 hours of recognizing the site as soft porn, the Domain Co took down the website. The website link (originally a legitimate website smoking prevention, but changed hands), had inadvertedly been published within company safety resource handbooks. \nThis affected 66, 532 Safety Books which were distributed in 6 Canadian provinces and 9 States, and posed a threat to children.\n\nI am committed to making sure our kids stay protected.......\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nIssues that I feel need to have more of the Board's Attention include:\n\n* The overwhelming class sizes; a real need to reduce the amount of students per class and also focus on the real validity of integrated classes to ensure all students get the education and attention they require so no student gets left behind\n* More LRSD staff feedback (Teachers, Support Staff, EA/TAs) need to be in place for smooth communication as to what works for some schools and where processes fail for others.\n* Ensuring all schools have implemented safety plans in place (fire, evacuation, narcotic awareness, cyber stalking, stranger danger and lock down modes)\n* More emphasis on the EA/TA roles in classrooms and supporting this valuable role in children's education in a class room setting\n* With more and more students arriving during the school year from other countries, there needs to be more support systems in place to integrate them accordingly with language requirements as to not frustrate the new student and at the same time to not occupy all the teachers time from trying to get around cultural and language barriers.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nTransportation - Safety concerns with regards to this \u0026 not Band-Aid cures with concerns to Pubic Transit - First and Foremost it is the School District's role to provide safe and reliable transportation to all students. After I made an issue about the issue with my article in  ‘The Lance’ and then they decided to run a 2nd story on the plight of our kids the following week, so many people approached me from all 4 Wards within the School District as they are not happy that they are living with the decisions made by parents in the district 15 years or even 6 years ago. It is approaching 2012, there are valid safety reasons our children are faced with everyday such as pedophiles being released, random acts of violence and abductions. No one wants their child to become a statistic- it’s time for the LRSD Board to take a moment and re-evaluate the policies and re-evaluate the bussing expenditures.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nAs a parent I believe there is nothing more important than the safety of our kids, whether its at home, in school or in between.\nThere is no greater peace of mind than the physical and mental well being or our children.\n \nAs a Taxpayer, I believe in Accountability. Everyone, including myself works hard to provide for our families and see that our kids are provided for. We all pay property taxes, a portion of which goes toward the School Division. As a taxpayer and area resident we need more information on where our money is being applied.\nThat's where the accountability factor comes in.\n \nLast but not least, I would like to mention the emphasis of quality Education, for all kids, of all ages, of all grades. The balance of learning and development for children is a crucial and basic need. All children need an education to help them grow and in turn shape the world. I am reassured that in the LRSD, we are giving our kids just that. It is a wonderful and excellent school division that provides our kids with promise and opportunity for the future.\n \nThe possibilities are endless","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":115,"electoral_race_id":24,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.731-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.731-05:00"},{"id":115,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 school board election?** \n\nFor a number of years I have increasingly become more interested in politics and where I could fit into the process. I want to be a more active member of my community which in my eye's view details becoming involved in representing those opinions and concerns expressed to me by my neighbours, friends, and acquaintances. I am a people person and for that reason I am an excellent choice for the position of School Trustee because people of all cultures, ages, and income levels have found that I am easy to relate with. People feel comfortable in sharing their thoughts, concerns and ideas and know that I always want to help and represent them whenever I can if they themselves do not feel comfortable in doing so. The characteristics I have are that I am a good listener, excellent at researching information and very good at public speaking. I am an idea person and don't like to simply point out problems but provide solutions as well.\n\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nIn my opinion a good trustee is one that can relate to those in the community they represent. I live in the Louis Riel School Division (LRSD) and have lived in the area for over 15 years. I first lived in Ward 2 and currently am living in Ward 3. I believe it is important that the elected individual has either attended school in the area or has children that have, or currently have enrolled children in LRSD. My three boys have attended Hastings School, Victor H.L. Wyatt, Dakota Collegiate and Glenlawn Collegiate. I take an active role in my boys’ education by being involved with volunteering in school activities and outings, being an active parent with the Parent/Teacher Council, and Safe Grad Committee. Other additional community involvement I have had is Heart \u0026 Stroke area coordinator, Canadian Diabetes canvasser, Welcome Wagon representative, co-organized Mom's group that ran out of the St. Vital Child \u0026 Family Services office, and Co-Chair for the second largest Winnipeg campaign for the United Way. These exemplify my capabilities as a leader in representing those in the division.\n\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nDrop-out rates of children have been on the rise and this concerns parents and educators. A way in which I think we can address this is by discontinuing the policy of pushing children ahead even when their marks do not warrant them to move on to the next grade.  Eventually it catches up and when these children do get into high school are frustrated and quit. It is our responsibility as parents and educators to show them the importance of continuing on to higher levels of education.\n \nBetter way to deal with bullying. Currently, the division policy is to suspend students that bully others. My personal connection as my son has been bullied in the past and was very upset on how it was handled by school administration. The student that was suspended had a few days off to basically enjoy himself at home to watch TV and play games. This did not send a good message and a better solution would be to have these children perform community volunteer work. A clearer message needs to be sent this behaviour is not okay and will not be tolerated.\n\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in your school division? In your ward?** \n\nI believe many schools would benefit from starting a breakfast program. Many people in the area do not realize the large population of lower income families that live in LRSD, and how many depend on various agencies to assist them monthly. We need to take initiative to begin a program that supports our children with a good start to their day.\n \nI do not think having a laptop computer to attend grade nine is a necessity. This past fall a pilot project was announced at Dakota Collegiate and many parents expressed concerns and frustration to me about it. Parents were not consulted, nor informed but simply told a laptop computer was a requirement, like a regular school supply item. Parents I spoke with expressed concerns that this was not an affordable expense a family could take on. Two related issues were the security of the laptop computer and how their child would be prevented from gaming, or visiting inappropriate websites. We need to get back to basics and when these children get to higher levels of education then they can choose whether or not a laptop computer is a requirement.\n\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \n\nMaking a difference to my children and the community is of great importance to me. People that know me know my commitment is my word and I live by my word. I am a good listener and people like to share their thoughts and opinions with me because I do care. When I am elected as School Trustee my commitment to the community will be to provide better transparency on board policies. I will strive to share and include them in the decision making of policies. I will conduct focal groups to discuss issues pertinent to their area of the school division as I recognize the individuality of each area.\n \nCaring about your children, you, and your tax dollars!\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":116,"electoral_race_id":24,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.749-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.749-05:00"},{"id":116,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 school board election?** \n\nMy decision to run for School Trustee stems from my commitment to both public service and the citizens of St. Vital.  I have worked with numerous community organizations within St. Vital and believe that my experience, passion and commitment to our community would be best served by representing our children.  As a parent, I believe that educating our children is the best investment we can make.  Solid education, clear communication and a sense of connection to our community help shape our children and ultimately lead to vibrant and healthier communities. \n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as school trustee?** \n\nI have lived and worked within the St. Vital community for over a decade.  I believe the only way we truly understand the values and needs of our community and schools is by being involved.  Throughout my many years serving on community committees, I have learned that listening to the concerns of others and a willingness to remain open-minded is critical when decision-making must meet both the needs of our community and the requirements of our schools.  As a mother of two sons in the public school system, I offer a parent's perspective in understanding the day to day challenges that face many families in this community.  In my capacity as a small business owner, I understand the importance of competent financial management.  Being financially accountable is an important factor in the role of a school trustee whose position includes decision-making on spending divisional funds.  I believe my community and work experiences have given me the skills necessary to offer an open, healthy and inclusive learning environment that will enrich the school experience of children, teaching professionals and parents.\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":117,"electoral_race_id":24,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.758-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.758-05:00"},{"id":117,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":118,"electoral_race_id":24,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.767-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.767-05:00"},{"id":118,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":119,"electoral_race_id":24,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.774-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.774-05:00"},{"id":119,"questionnaire":"**1. Why did you decide to run in the 2010 Winnipeg election?**\n\nI decided to run in the 2010 civic election because I believe people need to be more directly connected to city hall. What do I mean by this statement? I mean that I am running so that people will have someone at city hall who will respond to the concerns of citizens in their ward and have a vision for the greater good of all citizens.\n\n**2. What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\n\nI bring a varied and extensive people background to my role as city councilor. I have worked in my own community as president of the Iraqi Community Centre and know first hand the difficulties many people face here in the city. My experience as a businessman has allowed me to hear the concerns of many in our ward who are striving to improve services for our citizens. Winnipeg is a diverse city and I believe I have the ability to to talk and listen to a wide range of people in and out of my ward to make Winnipeg a better city. At the end of the day civic government is all about people and improving their lives as well as responding to their concerns.\n\n**3. What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nThere are many issues our city faces: Criminal activity by gangs, such as drug dealing and car theft, and the problem of poverty in our city. Their is a need to improve housing for many and the current level of people using food banks needs to be addressed. I choose these problems because they are issues that effect the quality of life of all citizens and all people deserve to live with dignity and respect.\n\nThe other issue is the need to continue to upgrade our city streets and sidewalks. Some of the streets and roads in Charleswood have not been repaired in many years. And finally, The issue of fair taxation needs to be addressed.\n\n**4.

I have always had a strong belief and dedication to public education and have wanted to be involved at the trustee level, however, I know myself well enough that if I am going to get involved in something like this I need to be able to commit myself wholeheartedly. In past elections I was not able to give the commitment I can afford now. I am at a place in my life where I can fully commit to trusteeship and bring my extensive experience to the table. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nMy experiences are diverse and provide a solid foundation to transition quickly into the role of trustee. All new jobs have a learning curve, but if you have the skills and experiences the transition becomes easier so you can become action oriented quicker. I have demonstrated repeatedly that am skilled in initiating new processes and programs. I took the lead when divisions amalgamated and created a divisional advisory council to ensure parent councils had input into the transition. I was instrumental in creating the 1st Early Childhood Wellness Fair in Transcona that are commonplace now. I worked with Manitoba Justice to have the 1st \"Lighthouse\" program in the division. I was on the 1st committee that created the Parent Child Coalition in Transcona. I set up a resource center that started the 1st \"walking school bus\" for children who had a long way to walk to school. I coordinated the 1st bilingual career exploration day in Manitoba that became a prototype for Canada. I have led fundraising events, sat on educational committees at divisional and provincial levels,and  participated in divisional budget meetings. I am confident my experiences are well rounded and will benefit the people of Ward 1.      \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI believe that my primary role as trustee is to find out what issues the schools and residents of  Ward 1 have and then to work with them and represent them at the board table. However, I do have areas/issues I would like to be involved with. Bullying: I want to be involved in research, see what our division does now and compare to what the global community is doing, and determine what else we can do.\r\nTechnology in the classrooms: I would like to be involved in our divisional assessments. It is a complicated issue because we want our students and teachers to have access, but does it improve outcomes for students overall, and if so, where do we find resources to fund this? I was on the Parent Advisory Council when the smart-boards came out. They are a wonderful tool for teachers and we wanted it in our school, however, there was no school budget for it so the PAC funded it. \r\nCommunity Engagement is vital: I have extensive experience working with and for people and working on committees to get things done and believe this will be one of my strengths as trustee in Ward 1.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI am so proud to live in Transcona. It is a wonderful, close knit community that deserves the best representation we can get. I have lived here for 23 years and came specifically to raise our family and be a part of a community. We could not have chosen better!\r\nI lived and went to school in the River East area so am also very familiar with that part of our school division and have friends and family throughout. I think our division as a whole, and especially our Ward is made up of people who are very proud, hard-working individuals who believe in community life. I have seen it over and over with friends, my children's friends, in the schools, and with all of the different committees and groups I have been a part of since we moved here. I don't think you will find that kind of commitment to community everywhere. The people, the community: that is why I would like the honour of representing them.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI will address the trustee responsibilities by:\r\n  - Ensuring I stay current with the changing education system\r\n  - Involving myself and listening to parents, students, teachers, and community members and groups\r\n  - Working with various groups such as the teachers associations, parent groups, and municipal offices.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 quotes on my promotional pamphlet that I would like to share:\r\n\r\n\"Sandy as a school trustee is an excellent investment in the future of our children\"\r\n\"Sandy has played a significant role in the education of young Manitobans\"\r\n\"Sandy Owczar leads with her heart, her mind and her soul.  Her vision for providing children with a better world to live is a model for all\"\r\n\r\nOne quote was provided recently, the other 2 were given as a result of work I have done in the past as an advocate in the community.  Thank you for those and to everyone who has helped my campaign - I feel very privileged to have so much support!!\r\n\r\nFinal quote - shared by a great educator in Transcona whom I respect tremendously and was instrumental in my childrens' success:\r\n \"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire\" W.B.

I am the mom of three children in the division and for this reason I wanted to care and serve the school division.  Ultimately, I decided to run because I want to work with parents, educators, administration, community leaders, volunteers, and the new team of trustees to increase student success. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nPublic engagement, consultation methods, program delivery, policy analysis, and program review is what I bring to the board. Day to day I have been responsible for bringing communities and government together in creative ways to get work done.  I currently work as a Policy Analyst with the Manitoba government.  I have over fifteen years of public sector experience.  I have been a business woman, co-owner of a non-profit, and a for profit company that among other things surveyed the first national event for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  I am a reliable community volunteer.  \r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nEducation is key to our economic prosperity and growth as a city, and as a province.  I stand for safe and inclusive schools; strengthening home and school partnerships; bullying prevention; services for students with special needs; arts education; continuing the work on full day kindergarten; changing the system so there is less reliance on property tax; improving transparency and engagement.\r\nOver the past fourteen years of marriage my husband and I have opened our home to nine teenagers as they moved into the city for post-secondary or secondary school.  I am familiar with the impact of chronic underfunding of on-reserve education and its impact on the school system in particular.  I was Vice President of Literacy Partners of Manitoba and a volunteer tutor including English as an additional language tutor.  I am an Aboriginal woman and there remains a lot of things to work on.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI appreciate that ward 1 residents expect to be served well on all the issues and that they expect a school trustee that can effectively build the relationships required to serve not only the ward effectively,but indeed the whole school division.\r\n\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nOui!  \r\n\r\nJe croit que fondamentalement, l’éducation est la clé de notre prospérité économique autant que pour la croissance au niveau de notre ville que pour notre province. Comme un analyste principale des politiques à temps plein, avec plus de quinze ans d'expérience dans le secteur public, je suis responsable de rapprocher les communautés et les gouvernements - de façons créatives. \r\n\r\nMoi puis mon mari Darcy, a trois enfants qui sont tous inscrits à la Division scolaire de Winnipeg. Comme la plupart des parents, la majorité de mes activités de bénévolat présents impliquent mes enfants et la communauté. \r\n\r\nJ'ai une conviction profonde de défendre les écoles sécuritaires et inclusives, les partenariats entre les familles et le milieu scolaire, la prévention de l'intimidation, les services aux élèves ayant des besoins spéciaux et l’éducation artistique.

I was annoyed at the destruction of democracy through too many closed door meetings and the rushing of key electoral changes through without proper consultation and I came to the realization that I am very well positioned to be a positive voice for change to get more people involved in the education of our children and to bring democracy back to the people.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI have an honours diploma in Computer Programming for which I recieved the Lieutenant Governor's Silver Medal. \r\n\r\nI've held positions on many volunteer boards in and around our area including tenures as President, VP Finance and Admin as well as several different positions as a convenor at Tyndall Park Community Centre. I have been the NWYS mini soccer director responsible for planning mini soccer for all of NorthWest Winnipeg  I have coached soccer, baseball, hockey, ball hockey, track \u0026 field and basketball and have worked with players from all across our division. \r\n\r\nMy children have attended or are currently attending Tyndall Park, Prairie Rose, Garden Grove, Stanley Knowles, Sisler and Tec Voc. I know the administration at many of the schools on a first name basis and have regular interaction with the Senior Administration in the school division. I attend parent council meetings at two seperate schools. I attend division budget as well as some special meetings.\r\n\r\nIn short, I know our ward, our schools and our division better than most and I am very well suited to transition into the Trustee role.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nToo much money is being spent on administration to the detriment of the education portion. We need to cut back on frivolous spending so that we can get more \"feet on the ground\" in our classrooms. Even though the provincial government as legislated smaller classroom size in the early years, we simply are not meeting those requirements. Our children are falling behind.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be an sustained effort by the current Trustee board to do as much as possible to exclude involvement from the residents of our ward. Too many closed door meetings, lackluster agendas and barely existent meeting minutes. Little proper notification of important issues and little time to discuss those issues. No apparent effort to involve the residents of our ward who do not have children. In short a sustained and embarrassing destruction of the democracy that we as citizens should be able to have. Together we will immediately reverse this trend.  We need to examine why volunteers and residents are getting less involved and what we can do to correct that.\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThe ability of the schools to be as inclusive as possible to children from all walks of life regardless of whom they are. or where they come from.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nWithout even being elected..strictly as a volunteer and having nothing to do with my campaign, I have been involved in meetings with schools and senior division administration totaling over 8 hours in one week.\r\n\r\nOnce elected I will work even harder to represent all the residents in our ward and division. Together we will work to get more people involved at all levels. We will give each other the tools to ensure an open democracy where everyone feels they are being listened to and to ensure our children are getting the best eduction we can offer.\r\n\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":154,"electoral_race_id":77,"created_at":"2014-09-14T04:18:49.777-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-12T10:27:32.760-05:00"},{"id":279,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI have been involved with my children's schools in Pembina Trails School Division for over 13 years in various capacities from volunteer, Chair of Parent Council, Chair of Lunch Program and Safe Grad just to name a few. I have also been involved many Pembina Trails School Division issues such as transportation, safety during lunch, new high school initiatives and healhy foods, working with Pembina Trails School Board and Trustees so this exposure was invaluable in my confidence in my ability to run and fulfill the responsibilities of a School Trustee in Pembina Trails School Divison - Ward 2. I am also very active and committed to the betterment of my community and our schools, and for these reasons I believe I can represent the parents and community members within the Division.  \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nMy experience includes both the volunteer roles I have played within the Pembina School Division over the past 13 years. I am also bilingual and my children attend both the English and French Immersion Programs in the Division. I have a Bachelor's Degree at the University of Manitoba and have been a Human Resources professional for over 20 years.  As a Human Resources Manager, I work with high school and post secondary students for work placements, apprenticeship programs, part-time, summer and full-time career opportunities. I believe strongly that by providing young people opportunities to put their education and skills into the workplace is a valuable component as part of their ongoing education and attainment of skills for their future. The role of the School Trustee includes school policies, programs and also strategic planning for long term vision, fiscal management and employee relations. As a part of my management responsibilities, I am involved in strategic planning, sound fiscal management and fostering strong employee relations. I believe my experience and background provide me a solid background of the issues and priorities of Pembina Trails School Division and the business acumen to incorporate those into policies and programs, representing families and taxpayers alike. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nSome of the issues I would like to stand for as a School Trustee are to:\r\n•\tLeverage our investments in existing Technology resources to maximize the learning opportunities for all student\r\n•\tFocus on effective use of tax dollars with the goal to hold the line on school property taxes\r\n•\tCommunicate with parents, and parent councils to understand the challenges and priorities of each school\r\n•\tImprove school resources, facilities and classroom settings to ensure students of all needs, backgrounds and abilities can learn in a safe and stimulating environment. \r\nThese issues are important to me as we need to ensure young people are engaged in their learning through the resources they and our educators have access to, including  technology, and that as a School Trustee I leverage these resources and investments with measurable benefits and that we are fiscally responsible to maximize our funds as we are accountable to our taxpayers. As a parent, I appreciate the opportunities to learn, participate and collaborate in school and divisional initiatives and parents have an integral role to play. As a School Trustee my role will be to ensure I listen, share and be available to families I represent. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThe one thing I can appreciate about the school division I wish to represent is the diversity of challenges faced by young people, families, educators, Board staff and the School Trustees in Pembina Trails School Division. There are so many factors to consider in setting priorities, programs, and budgets, listing just a few such as the spectrum of student needs, the availabiltiy of creative and engaging resources and technology within the classroom for students and educators, the cost of resources, and the desire and the expectations to offer young people a variety of choices so their education will prepare them for ongoing educational pursuits and/or the workforce. The balancing of all these challenges and desire to enure Pembina Trails School Division provides stimulating environment for all students to learn is an aspect I appreciate about the Division I wish to represent. \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI would be honored to represent the families and taxpayers within Pembina Trails School Division - Ward 2 and believe my past experience and current involvement in our schools within Pembina Trails Division, my background and skills I can effectively represent the working families and taxpayers in our community and Pembina Trails School Division-Ward 2. I welcome the opportunity to speak with community members and can be reached various ways listed on the candidate profile on City of Winnipeg Election website.  \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":247,"electoral_race_id":58,"created_at":"2014-09-13T00:59:55.911-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-02T15:08:17.813-05:00"},{"id":321,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI was elected in 2010 to represent the former larger Ward 2. For many years, I had been active as a volunteer working in housing and safety issues in my inner city neighbourhood. This work brought me in touch with many families from diverse backgrounds. Many were newcomers to Canada and Aboriginal families. I feel that education is the best way for these families to succeed and I wanted to bring my experience as a inner city resident and volunteer to the Winnipeg School Division. A student beginning school today will graduate in 2030 into a world that is different than today's world and one with rapid changes. It is important to provide children with the skills to adapt to change and the capacity for life-long learning and critical thinking. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI have over thirty years of work experience in the not-for-profit heritage and cultural sectors. I currently work as a professional fundraiser. For 4 years, I taught art history at the University of Manitoba. I am also a recognized visual artist and have studied music for the past fifteen years. I live in the inner city and have visited all the schools in the area that I represented since 2010. For twenty years, I have worked as a volunteer board member for various organizations and currently chair the Central Neighbourhoods Development Corporation. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI support providing children with the resources to ensure their success. In additional to excellent classroom instruction and sound buildings, this includes things like the reading recovery program, clinical services for children who need help seeing, hearing, speaking and learning and nutrition programs. I have supported upgrades to technology in high school and alternative programs for teens who attend special programs and trades education. Nothing has made me prouder than to see teens who could not fit into mainstream schools  graduate from Argyle Alternative School or see adults receive their high school diplomas surrounded by their grandchildren. I have been pleased to see young children share their science and heritage projects with the public. I support learning in the visual arts and music as this is a way to build skills and creativity that are transferable to learning other subjects. I am looking forward to seeing the results of the pilot program for all day kindergarten that was implemented this year.  I also support learning of Aboriginal languages and history because our Aboriginal students need to see their importance to our society. These are all the means to build learners who can adapt to ongoing change and contribute to Manitoba. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI appreciate that the Winnipeg School Division serves families from widely diverse cultural and economic circumstances. Many families in our division struggle with poverty and housing issues and this means we have a high student migrancy rate. We also have a higher number of special needs children, Aboriginal children and newcomer children. I have supported the programs that go beyond basic instruction and will continue to do so to ensure student success.  \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nAs a trustee at the Winnipeg School Division for the past 4 years, I have worked hard as a member of at least 7 committees each year. For the past 2 years, I served as Chair of the Finance Committee and voting member of the Policy and Program Committee. I have attended countless events at schools where I have enjoyed and appreciated the accomplishments of the students and teachers at the Winnipeg School Division. We also have dedicated administrators and support staff. On my visits to schools, I have viewed many classrooms and seen some of the special programs and clinical services that the Winnipeg School Division provides. I have also attended the annual Manitoba School Boards Association Conferences to learn about education-related issues such as the development of the brain in the early years, the special importance of reading instruction, bullying and gender issues and so on. Ongoing learning about education and governance is critical for trustees too.  \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":82,"electoral_race_id":74,"created_at":"2014-09-14T03:54:00.685-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-02T16:06:12.372-05:00"},{"id":281,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI feel there are many issues that I raised in my first term that are unresolved and need to be raised again.  This, I feel would benefit all students, staff, parents and the rest of the community/the public.  I want to make public school boards public again.  I have a passion for education and want to see \"the real\" best practices being used in our schools. I ran on 4 basic issues in 2010 and want to continue, to improve these areas in 2014.  My 4 basic issues are 1. Safe, Healthy Schools, 2. More Open, Transparent, Relational, Accountable School Board, 3. Greater Parent / Resident Involvement and 4. Programs / Program Reviews.  [Please see my webpage] (http://edrhume.com) for my political platform and more details about me.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI feel a bring a wealth of experience to compliment my role as a School Trustee.  First, I am a retired teacher with 33 years of teaching experience.  Since retirement in 2007, I have continued to stay active in the classroom as a substitute teacher in 4 Winnipeg school divisions (last 7years) and am currently employed in them.  Over 40 years experience in the classroom!  Secondly I have 3 degrees from the University of Manitoba, Bachelor of Physical Education (BPE), Bachelor of Education (BPE) and a Masters of Education (M Ed).  Thirdly, I'm a parent of 3 daughters who graduated from the St. James School Division.  Finally, I believe in professional developemnt for school trustees and try hard to stay current/ up to date by regular attendance at conferences/workshops.  \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nSome of my issues include: the continued use of part time caretakers in St James at 10/15 of our elementary schools since 1994 when all other school divisions use only full day caretakers.  This issue in my opinion presents a health and safety risk which I feel would be unacceptable to the majority of the public who are unaware of this situation.  If re-elected I plan on taking a public petition back to the new school board to rectify this unjust situation!  Please go to my webpage (edrhume.com) for more detail.  Other issues in my opinion include: a governance change from the present use of the Business Corporate Model to the Parliamentary Model where individual trustees have more power to act on behalf of the community who elect them!  The whole area of special needs, needs to be re-evaluated.  In my opinion, we don't employ enough occupational therapist, and physiotherapists to help train and guide our educational assistants (EA's) who work daily with these students.  I feel a need for more open and transparent communication with the parents and the community.  [Please check my website] (http://edrhume.com) for my whole political platform and more detail about these previously mentioned issues.   \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThere are some great things happening in St. James-Assiniboia which I appreciate: 1. We have a very well trained, hard working and dedicated staff.  2. There are great opportunities for professional development for our staff through conferences and workshops.  Our division offers a wide variety of great programs including, strong athletic and musical programs, International Baccalaureate (IB program), solid vocational programing at Sturgeon Heights / St. James Collegiate and Jameswood Alternative School (only 2 exist in Winnipeg!)  We also have a strong technology program which includes a fibre optic network and Wi-Fi connections in all our schools.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am a candidate who believes in continual improvement of a school board, the status quo does not cut it!  Just like we expect improvement in our staff and students, school boards also need to improve, setting an example for their staff.  How can we tell them they need to embrace change and improve when we as a board don't set the example?  We need to walk the talk.  In St. James we have \"Great Schools for Learning and Growing\" but I want to make them the \"The Best Schools for Learning and Growing\" through the TEAM approach (Together Everyone Achieves More).

There was no one from the health care system to advocate for our 15 year old son. We placed our faith in the system and he died from an undiagnosed case of bacterial meningitis. He had been ill for several weeks and had all of the classic symptoms. However, he was sent home from the emergency ward and within 2 days we were back. Our son passed away in the hospital less than 48 hours later.\r\n\r\nIn October 2006 with encouragement from families in the community I decided to run and was fortunate to be elected. This community gave our family their support when we needed it most. For me being a school trustee is not a stepping stone for a future career in politics. Rather, it allows me the opportunity to \"give back\" by being a strong advocate for the children.\r\n\r\nI am grateful to our community for giving me purpose and their trust over the past 8 years and to continue to serve would be an honour. This is for my sons James and his big brother \"Little\" John (1991-2006).\r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nThe experience I have gained over the last 2 terms along with my education (BA-Honours degree with my thesis in developmental child psychology) has been invaluable. I, along with my wife Wendy have lived in Ward 2 since 1988.Our sons John and James attended schools in the ward with James graduating in 2011 from Kildonan-East Collegiate.\r\n\r\nI also have sat on 4 parent advisory councils and understand the challenges they sometimes face. As being the only incumbent I know very well the strengths and the weaknesses within our school division. It is with this knowledge and experience that I will continue to strive to move our school division forward. I also have had the opportunity to sit on liaison and negotiation committees as well as all standing board committees.\r\n\r\nFurther, I feel that I have good working relationship with our local MLAs and city councillors as well as with the aboriginal leaders in our community. I have always and will continue to make myself available to all stakeholders.\r\n\r\nFinally, I was raised in a family with strong core values with the philosophy that one must always do the right thing no matter how difficult and unpopular that decision may be.\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI have always been a strong supporter of the literacy and numeracy initiatives that have been implemented. The ability to read and to comprehend what was read is of paramount importance. Math skills are also crucial and are constantly required throughout one's life. These core skills cannot and shouldn't ever be under estimated in their importance in education. I will continue to push for more resources in these areas with this in mind.\r\n\r\nI also understand the importance of technology but there must be an educational value to it. However, the present 5 year replacement program may need to be reviewed but because of our small commercial tax base we have to consider the cost to the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nSince becoming a parent in 1991 I have never heard one parent complain about a lack of technology in the classroom. Rather, their constant concern is about how there should be more emphasis on the basics skills. I agree fully and hopefully we'll see a continued shift in emphasis in the provincial curriculum, in which we as school divisions must follow, towards these core skills. \r\n\r\nWe also need to continue to work harder at keeping our school environment safe – for everyone.\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nOur school division excels in many areas but there will always be room for improvement. Our special needs programming is well known throughout the province. We have vibrant International Baccalaureate (IB) and Advanced Placement (AP) programs. There also has been a refocus of more resources on reading and writing skills. Further, the recently developed specialized learning   environment for at risk students is proving to be a success in keeping students in high school.\r\n\r\nThis focus on trying to engage students in their education and how important education is to their future is a goal that is emphasised by all division employees. Whether it is the classroom teacher or the school custodian they all understand that they have a role to play in a student's success in school.\r\n\r\nOur vocational programing is excellent and has produced winners in worldwide competitions. My son, James, who recently graduated with a duel diploma is presently apprenticing in the HVAC trade which he loves.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities offered to our students are phenomenal. I have had the pleasure to interview students who have been nominated for divisional gold medals. Though there can be only one winner I have been impressed by the caliber of the nominees.\r\n\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nFirst, I would like to thank Open Democracy Manitoba for creating this website. Over the last 8 years my wife, who is an educator, and I have had some interesting conversations with both the educator's perspective and the trustee's perspective being represented. We are almost always on the same page.\r\n\r\nWhen the province makes changes in curriculum, etc. her perspective is from how this affects the classroom environment and her teaching of the students. In other words her perspective is from an operational position. My perspective on the other hand is from a governance standpoint which involves looking at the big picture on how this affects the school division as a whole including students as well as the taxpaying homeowner. Often this is where we run into difficulties. We may both agree in theory but it's with the implementation and its consequences financially where we run into problems.\r\n\r\nAs a board it often comes down to cost because of inequities in provincial funding to school divisions. We as a board set direction but it is the educators that are responsible for the operational decisions. We depend on their expertise when it comes to how the curriculum is implemented and taught.\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":35,"electoral_race_id":79,"created_at":"2014-09-12T00:58:23.168-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-11T09:16:45.647-05:00"},{"id":226,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nI have observed City Hall since 1965, when I was Metro and City Hall Reporter for the Winnipeg Tribune. Most of my subsequent career in the Provincial Government, serving twice as Deputy Minister of Urban Affairs, was devoted to helping make our City government work better. Two years ago I discovered that there was serious mismanagement and misconduct occurring at City Hall, especially among some of the senior administrators, and that the City Council was unable or unwilling to fix it. I began to appear at Council and its Committees regularly, asking questions, demanding answers, and offering practical solutions. By this summer it had become obvious that the present Council would not fix things. I looked around, and concluded that none of the other candidates for mayor would be willing or able to deal effectively with the situation now. Most had been nowhere near City Hall. Given my extensive experience, knowledge and administrative skills, I decided that I had better offer to take on the job myself, to overhaul City Hall and make it possible for us to manage our resources wisely once again, and make Winnipeg a safe, fair and fun place for all.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Mayor?\n\nI have 45 years’ senior executive experience in Winnipeg, as a lawyer, public administrator, management consultant, property and business tax consultant, university teacher and administrator, marketing manager and journalist. I worked in many different departments of the Government of Manitoba for 18 years, but most of the time I dealt with City of Winnipeg legislation, financial affairs, and land use plans. I have also been a national government computer systems marketing manager for Unisys Canada Inc., and a lecturer and faculty administrator at the University of Manitoba. I have served as a professional management consultant with a specialty in human resources management, and for the past 20 years I have been engaged in seeking fair property and business tax assessments for most major commercial and institutional property owners in Winnipeg. I maintain my status as a practising lawyer in order to conduct selected pro bono cases, in the public interest. Throughout my life I have provided active leadership for university, professional, school, community, sports, and charitable organizations, so I fully appreciate the character and strengths of our community. And I will hit the ground running, because I have participated in most debates at City Hall for the past two years.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Mayor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nAs Mayor, I will lead a progressive majority of Council in taking action to achieve the following objectives:\r\n1. End the mismanagement, misconduct and secrecy in decision-making at City Hall.\r\n2. Restore public trust in our City government.\r\n3. Reveal the full extent of the financial mess left behind by current and previous Councils, and establish a realistic plan to manage the City’s financial affairs wisely, going forward.\r\n4. Restore and maintain basic City services and infrastructure.\r\n5. Reconsider the justification and priorities for major projects, such as the Southwest Transitway, and proceed with revised plans for those projects which are most necessary and financially feasible.\r\n6. Secure intergovernmental cooperation and collaboration with the federal, provincial, Capital Region municipal governments, and First Nations.\r\n7. Curb the exorbitant costs of extending infrastructure to accommodate urban sprawl.\r\n8. Empower citizens to play a much more meaningful role in City decision-making, always.\r\nThese matters are important to me, because I love Winnipeg and I want it to be a safe, fair and fun place to be, not only for my extended family, but for all Winnipeggers, now and in the future. We can be a model green, affordable, compassionate and prosperous community.\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the City of Winnipeg?\n\nWinnipeg is the “Heart of the Continent,” as CBC weatherman Ed Russenholt used to say every evening, a very long time ago, and we Winnipeggers have really big hearts. We are generous with our time, money and talents. We are generous on a City-wide scale, as with the United Way, the Winnipeg Foundation, Winnipeg Harvest, and countless other charitable and non-profit organizations and projects. We are generous within our neighbourhoods, volunteering, coaching, fundraising, and working together. And we are generous with each other, with our neighbours, friends and families.\r\nThis same generosity of spirit extends to our willingness to support a full range of universally available public services in healthcare, education, transportation, recreation, libraries, and many other community functions, whether or not we use them ourselves.\r\nI feel we are family. I know that not all Winnipeggers are able to enjoy that feeling yet, but if it is possible to achieve that goal anywhere, I believe we can do it here.\r\n\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nAs candidate for Mayor of Winnipeg, I believe I have the most extensive experience and training in government and public finance; special knowledge of the City's history, communities, businesses and institutions; a lifelong passion for serving to improve the quality of life of all citizens; and demonstrated ability to seek truth, fairness and justice, without fear or favour. I have been an especially active participant and critic at City Hall for almost two years, and I am ready to deal with the many challenges and opportunities immediately following the election.\r\nI seek to champion a resilient green City, a youth-friendly and age-friendly City, a financially viable and responsible City, a respectful and inclusive City. Working together, we can be all that, and more.\r\nAt the Advance Polls, and on October 22nd, I urge all citizens to get out and vote for the school trustees, the city councillors, and the Mayor, and ensure that Winnipeg gets the government it needs now. \r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":218,"electoral_race_id":2,"created_at":"2014-08-07T10:16:47.746-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-11T14:00:41.104-05:00"},{"id":223,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nBack in the 1980's while upgrading my education then studying to be an insurance broker, I met long time NDP City Councillor Magnus Eliason who became my friend and mentor and I have been involved in politics ever since. I have ran before and have also worked behind the scenes in the political process. I believe I can be a vibrant independent voice for the people of Daniel Mac. I have a strong social conscience combined with good business acumen that has served me well in the world.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nI ran for city council in 1989. The wards were smaller back then. I ran in the Redboine Ward which also included the west end and had been represented by long time NDPer and CCFer Magnus Eliason. He fully supported me in my efforts. I ran for the NDP and was endorsed by the Winnipeg Labour Council. I lost by a heartbreaking 100 votes.  I ran for School Trustee in 1995 coming in 6th out of more than 20 other candidates. I have also worked behind the scenes. Throughout the 1990s I served as the Legislative Assistant for Dr. Conrad Santos, the long time NDP MLA who represented the Broadway then the Wellington Constituency. I have served on numerous Boards and Commissions in my life and continue to work as an interpreter with the Winnipeg Police Services, various branches of the legal system, the Workers Compensation Board, as well as the Immigration and Refugee Board. I've also been successful building my own business so I have a good business mind combined with my compassionate spirit. I have political experience plus close ties to the ward both in terms of my professional and personal life.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n1. Accountability and Transparency: We need an Oversight Committee so that we don't have the cost over-runs or shady business deals that we have had the last 10 years.\r\n2. Infrastructure and Transportation: Starting in the Spring of 2015 we need pothole crews working 24/7 on our streets and back lanes and in the winter we need timely snow removal from our sidewalks and streets without blocking people's access to their properties.\r\n3. Community Safety: Reduce or eliminate photo radar and put Cadets and Police Officers where they are most effective-in our Schools, Community Centres and on our streets. \r\n4. Environment: Develop a recycling depot in the area that takes everything from bottles to batteries and compost.\r\n5. Rejuvenation of Sargent and Ellice Avenues: I believe with the expansion of the University of Winnipeg and our designation as Centre Port this has become an even more pressing issue. Sargent and Ellice can rival both Osborne and Corydon and the dynamic communities they represent.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nFrom my professional, volunteer, political and personal experience with the ward I know it's an incredibly diverse, multicultural mosaic made up a of myriad of communities. In essence, it is a host of communities within the Daniel Mac community itself.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI want people to know that I'm readily accessible.

I am a teacher and I can relate to the successes and struggles that a teacher may have in their day to day role as educator and mentor to our young students.  I know first hand how a school operates.  The dynamic between administrators and staff is unique and is best dealt with by someone who understands it and has experience with it.  My strong background in Economics will be a big asset in providing sound fiscal management and ensuring that taxpayer money is spent efficiently and effectively.  \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI have sat on Boards and committees and know how they work and function and conversely how they can be stalled.

I am and have been in charge of large budgets and know how to manage these budgets without any deficit.

It has been proven time and again that a proper diet coupled with proper amounts of exercise is extremely beneficial to a child's overall well being and academic success.  It is important for me to ensure our tax dollars are being spent effectively and efficiently.  Do our teachers have the necessary tools for success?  Do they have proper access to ongoing Professional Development?  Do parents have a proper voice?  Do parents have the access they need to be heard?  I stand for all of these issues and will ensure that the answer is yes to all of these questions.\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI appreciate the genuine care and concern the residents of Pembina Trails have for their children and for their children's success.  This is a very involved community which is great.  Our residents need the very best people on the Board to ensure that their children's needs and concerns are treated with respect and the utmost concern.  A Trustee needs to be accountable and accessible and I will provide both.  Everyone wants what is best for their child.  I will do everything that I can to ensure this is the case.  \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI bring unique traits to the Office of School Trustee.  I am a current teacher with a strong background in Economics and Finance.  I am relevant.  I have two young sons who will be entering the Division shortly.

I will be a natural ally for the teachers ensuring that they have the necessary tools for success in the classroom.  Manitoba's education system ranks last in Canada.  It is time for change.

I have also managed environmental regulatory programs at Fisheries and Oceans Canada.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI support new development that is consistent with the surrounding community and that provides for a need in the community.  At a recent public meeting when asked a similar question I emphasized that new development has to occur in the context of the existing neighbourhood and that it seems developers are planning our city which is not necessarily in the best interests of the majority of Winnipeggers.\r\n\r\nI want to help Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge residents work through controversial developments in a way that does not pit proponents against established neighbourhoods.  It is important to me because of my innate sense of fairness to implement a transparent community consultation process and objective city planning that addresses and mitigates neighbour's concerns.  \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nCharleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge I think the most pressing issue is managing future development planned for the ward in a way that does not compromise what makes Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge special and unique.  Whether its the Harte Trail, Assiniboine Forest or the green space behind your house where you grew up playing we need to ensure a no net loss principle of those areas residents use for outdoor recreational activity on a daily basis.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI have been married for 15 years to Blair La Croix, a Wildlife Officer and our son Joshua La Croix is the fourth generation in Charleswood.\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect from Nadine…\r\n\r\nFind the right fiscal balance that makes real progress for Winnipeggers\r\n•\tAdvocate for long term financial planning\r\n•\tImplement Capital Project Planning Cycles\r\n•\tBalance maintenance of existing communities with new developments\r\n\t\r\nImprove our roads, trails and transit \r\n•\tTackle the Infrastructure Deficit\r\n•\tAdvocate for public transportation that makes sense\r\n•\tSupport active transportation initiatives\r\n\t \r\nModernize our water and wastewater systems; improve waste collection\r\n•\tApply innovation and advancements to system maintenance\r\n•\tSet clear priorities for system upgrades\r\n•\tImplement a meaningful performance measurement system for waste collection aimed at demonstrating continuous improvement \r\n\r\nFight for fairness, transparency and more results out of City Hall – results that benefit everyone\r\n•\tClear, fair and open decisions\r\n•\tImplement values and ethics based decision making at all levels at City Hall\r\n•\tImprove contracting and procurement processes so that they are more effective and efficient\r\n \r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":219,"electoral_race_id":44,"created_at":"2014-08-14T00:58:52.764-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-13T14:59:46.057-05:00"},{"id":259,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI made a decision to run for a school trustee 2 years ago when I was retiring from 32 years as a teacher and school principal in Frontier and River East Transcona School divisions. I grew up in Transcona, my wife and I, as well as our children all attended Transcona schools and I still live in the community. I value the quality of education in our division and want to be part of enhancing it so our children, grandchildren and their children all have opportunities for success today and tomorrow. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nMy 32 years of experience as an educator and school administrator provide me with a perspective of the classroom as well as school and divisional operations. I believe I can bring an educational perspective and voice to the board of trustees. I have also served on various boards in different roles for community clubs and currently as President of the Transcona Major Jr Hockey Club all in the spirit of making our community a better place and providing our youth with positive lifestyle options. \r\n \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n In reality there are two key areas that I want to focus on and have focused on throughout my career, that of fostering a positive learning environment for students to all be successful as well as ensuring their safety and well being. All issues that a school and school board deal with should revolve around these both today and for tomorrow. Academic success looks different for all students but should be driven from school data and purposefully planned for improvement while being fiscally responsible to the constituents of Transcona. \r\nTo identify one or two specific issues at this time would not be practical without collecting data and feedback from all stakeholders in the system. I welcome the opportunities to work with various stakeholders and decision makers. I believe in collaboration, open dialogue and ensuring everyone has input or voice so they feel part of the process which builds trusting relationships. \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\n Transcona is a special community and I am proud to be part of it, in the same way as I am proud to have been a part of a very progressive educational system. RETSD offers quality programming throughout the levels from early numeracy and literacy programs in EY to IB in SY. RETSD is also responsive to the learning trends in education as well as the needs of the community, as illustrated through the exceptional EAL programming offered for so many new Canadians entering our system.\r\n- While RETSD is able to provide diverse, differentiated and specialized learning it still maintains one of the lowest per student costs in the province.\r\n-\tTeaching and support staff are being presented with more and more diverse classrooms hosting a wide range of abilities, and require resources and strategies to support these needs.\r\n-\tEarly intervention is crucial. . \r\n-\tSince schools and school sites were not designed to handle this level of traffic flow we now have enormous safety issues around most of our EY schools. This needs to be reviewed with parents, staff  and community members to look at alternatives for getting children to school and home safely.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI have always seen myself as a supporter of learning, as a teacher, a coach and school principal. The most important people in education are those working directly with children as they have the most direct influence on students. I hope to continue to supporting education from a different perspective but also helping to prioritize educational needs for today and tomorrow while taking responsibility for costs of this education\r\nAs a committed trustee I will;\r\n\t-work collaboratively with others  \r\n\t-listen carefully to the needs of those within the system and the community \r\n\t-use what I hear to make informed decisions for the division as a whole \r\n\t -communicate those decisions back to all stakeholders\r\n\t -be available and responsive to questions/concerns from the community\r\n\t- model on-going learning \r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":239,"electoral_race_id":78,"created_at":"2014-09-12T00:31:50.324-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-13T21:04:20.540-05:00"},{"id":123,"questionnaire":"**1. Why did you decide to run in the 2010 Winnipeg election?**\n\nI decided to run because I feel I can make a difference. I am passionate about this ward and a fully committed to representing it full time. I am a big proponent of community efforts and I believe investing in communities pays off on a larger scale. Safe, strong communities, lead to safe,strong neighbourhoods, which then lead to a safe strong city.\n\n**2. What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\n\nI have extensive customer service experience  and am used to dealing with the public on many issues that arise. I have presided on a board where I have learned that teamwork is vital, and have been involved in project management where I listen and engage and try to seek the best solution before making a decision.  \n\n**3. What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nThe major issues I like to stand for are traffic safety and the community clubs. I want to be part of affordable recreation. I have a vested interest as a constituent first, and want to do things for the community that I actually have control over. Crime is a very big concern and I feel a need for stronger police presence but with greater support and resources to enable them to do their job effectively. I actually speak to officers .Most break and enters or car thefts involve property and items that can be replaced. If someone is speeding or driving reckless in the neighbourhood, the result can lead to more severe consequences such as a fatality. That is lost forever.\n\n**4. Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\n I would love to be part of a cultural change. We have a great city. We need to move forward and support initiatives that make our city stronger. People have to believe in the city to make this happen and I want to be part of that. I am fortunate to live in and hopefully represent a great ward. I don't want to \"'change\" anything as much as enhance an already great area even more.\n\n**5. Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\nI only want to say that this is a very exciting time for our ward, but changes are coming to the entire city.

Why did you decide to run in the 2010 Winnipeg election?**\n\nWhen I heard that Bill Clement had passed away, I realized it was vital to find someone as qualified as possible to represent us as councillor.  I would like to combine my professional experience as a real estate and small business lawyer, with my 46 years in our community, to be a knowledgeable, experienced and approachable advocate for our ward.  I know that I can serve as an independent, unbiased representative.  My agenda is simply to make our community the best it can be.\n\n**2. What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\n\nI grew up in Charleswood and have lived here all my life. My family has been involved in so many of Charleswood’s organizations since the 1960’s.  My wife and I and our two step-daughters live here and attended our schools.  I have practiced law for 18 years, 16 years in private practice in our community; dealing with issues such as senior’s estate planning, real estate and small business law.  This gives me valuable experience in dealing with community issues, the City, Province, courts, community committee meetings and municipal councils.  I’m used to helping the public navigate the complexities of bureaucracies and get results.\n\n**3. What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nInfrastructure:   We need a careful watch over preserving what we value in our community, while overseeing improved roads and traffic flow, inevitable infill development, and development of new communities in open spaces.  This includes ensuring Kapyong Barracks is redeveloped in a manner that compliments the existing neighbourhood.  Transparency: I feel strongly about increased transparency in government, and believe an honest government has nothing to hide.  Fiscal responsibility:  I want to see value for my tax dollar, but see a careful need to balance that with preserving and renewing an aging infrastructure.\n\n**4. Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city?**\n\nI would like to see more forward thinking and planning.  For example, proper roads should precede development.  I look forward to hearing the proposals from the Infrastructure Funding Council, as to alternatives to funding infrastructure renewal, aside from relying entirely on property taxes.  \n\nIn your ward?  Roads and drainage need more attention.  Traffic lights are needed by the senior’s centres on Grant.  Intersections and roads leading to Wilkes need improvement and traffic control.  Completion of the inner perimeter (for us, extending the Parkway South to Wilkes and beyond) will allow access to new communities being developed, relieve congestion on Kenaston and spare Charleswood homeowners who live South of Grant excessive volumes of traffic.  Whyte Ridge has traffic and traffic light design problems that need to be addressed, as well as playground maintenance issues.  Community centres need attention, and discussions need to be entered into as to how to have them best serve our community. \n\n**5. Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\nIt is my intention to scale back my law practice to make serving our community my full time priority.

What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nMunicipal Funding Formual  - important  to get our independence in how we spend our money and what we want to Plan for the City in the next 50 years.\n\nCommunity Funding Formula - as you probably guessed, the money must trickle down to the grassroots so they can complete projects that bring immediate relief and provide a positive impact to our neighborhoods.\n\n**4.

There needs to be more planning between City Hall, its departments and other stakeholders, such as Waste and Water, Manitoba Hydro, and others.  \r\n\r\nImproved snow clearing: Sidewalks need to be cleared to concrete, and snow removal in back-lanes must be done more frequently and thoroughly. People with mobility issues, health issues and seniors will need safe clear sidewalks in order to make it safely to these new community mail boxes.\r\n\r\nOff-leash dog areas: I want to work with WINDOG and other stakeholder and create a working group to come up with a plan to create and sustain off-leash dog areas throughout the city.

Why did you decide to run in the 2010 Winnipeg election?**\n\nThere are a number of reasons that compelled me to run as City Councilor. It is difficult to say which one was the most important since they all influenced me in making my decision to run. As an immigrant I have felt so grateful to the people of Winnipeg who welcomed me into their hearts and homes. As a result I have always felt a strong need to repay the hospitality the people of this city have shown me. I also believe that the city is at a turning point. I have sensed in the last few years that the city has made a noticeable positive change. I want to be part of a city council that continues to move the city forward.  Finally as a candidate in the last federal election I made a real connection with the people in the Elmwood – East Kildonan area.  When I was asked to consider running as a councilor by some of the residents of Elmwood – East Kildonan I felt honoured, seriously considered the request and was ultimately convinced to accept the challenge. \n\n**2. What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\n\nCommunity Involvement\n\nI founded a charity, the Amadeus Steen foundation in memory of our son which funds worthwhile projects for children and youths. Understanding Public Service is essential for a city councilor.  \n\nCommitment to Excellence\n\nAs a professional athlete I understood the type of commitment and drive that it takes to excel at the highest level. As a City Councilor I will demand the same standard of excellence for myself, the city administration and in the services we provide to the citizens of Winnipeg.  \n\nLeadership \n\nAs Captain of the Winnipeg Jets players I was called upon by, fans, and team management, to motivate the players on the team to perform to their best of their abilities. In the same way I will provide leadership at city hall with my fellow councilors and ensure that we are focused on our goal, which is to provide excellent services to the citizens.     \n\nVision \n\nAs a professional hockey scout I had to analyze the potential of up and coming hockey talent to determine their potential as professional. As City Councilors we are called upon to evaluate new ideas and program and quickly discern what fits with the long term plans and needs of Winnipeg.    \n\n**3. What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nFrom my discussions with community leaders and the residents of Elmwood-East Kildonan I have developed a platform that is resonating throughout the ward. If elected I am committed to the following: \n\n\n* Ensuring the safety of our streets and homes through proven crime prevention programs that work closely with the community and the Winnipeg Police Services.\n\n* Working with all levels of government in order to access infrastructure funds to maintain streets and services in Elmwood – E.K.   \n\n* Developing and maintaining recreational spaces and programs.\n\n* Demanding value for our tax dollars.\n\n**4. Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nCity of Winnipeg\n\nAs I already mentioned I believe that the City of Winnipeg is at a turning point. We are moving in the right direction in terms of creating a positive environment. We need to continue this and finds ways to encourage more investment. We also need to have proven crime prevention programs implemented which work very closely with the community and Winnipeg Police Services to ensure that our streets and neighborhoods are safe for all. At the same time we need to create a positive environment for city employees so that they are motivated to provide excellent services. If we can maintain this momentum over time we can create a prosperous and safe city with affordable quality services. \n\nElmwood – East Kildonan     \n\nThis is an area of the city that has been underrepresented by its elected officials in the past. There is a real opportunity this election to make a change from this pattern and in turn send a strong message that this area wants to contribute and be part of the revitalization of the city.  \n\n**5.

In order for that to happen, it is vitally important for the new city councillor to be tirelessly dedicated to ending the cycle of waste and urban decay that is perpetuated by City Hall.\n\nThe major issues I stand for are ending waste and corruption at City Hall.\n\n**4. Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nIf Mayor Katz has taught Winnipeggers anything, it is that private interests must be kept separate from public interests.  Whether it’s Sam’s dealings with Crocus, the MTS Centre cash giveaway to Mark Chipman, Sam’s Goldeyes parking arrangement, the Asper stadium-mall-Bomber deal, or the more crucial secret water/waste management contract with Veolia, we (City Council) can’t allow private, commercial interests to compromise Winnipeg’s public interests ever again.\n\nIn regards to changing the Elmwood – East Kildonan ward, I would like to instill a sense of community \u0026 public safety in every single neighbourhood.  Every person should have a safe place to grow, be loved \u0026 realize one’s own potential.  Every citizen should be free to leave their home to walk the streets, 24/7, without the fear of being robbed or assaulted.  This can happen if we, the electorate, collectively choose to reverse the cycle of waste \u0026 urban decay.\n\n**5.

Why did you decide to run in the 2010 Winnipeg election?**\n\nWinnipeg's history is one of incredible Vision and Optimism, in Business, The Arts, and in Political Leadership. When I moved here in 1978 it was the greatest city on the prairies and known and respected across the continent!. Since then it has been declining and has lost that reputation.\n\nTen years ago this decline started to bother me and I became more politically involved. I have become convinced that Winnipeg's and Manitoba's biggest problem is lack of political vision and lack of confidence in the city's potential that is … unfortunately... often exacerbated by the very people we elect to govern this city and province.\n\nI have traveled extensively in my work as a musician. That experience has convinced me that Winnipeg , situated at the centre of the continent with the cheapest and most reliable electric power on the continent, has the most exciting potential as a city of the future, but without leadership without Optimism and Vision and BELIEF in that potential , we are doomed to continue moldering along in mediocrity.\n \n**2. What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\n \nThe main activity of a  musician is communication about all the wonders and difficulties of life through music. Without words and dealing only in the momentary existence of our creations, our integrity - the truthfulness of our message and our commitment to it – becomes obvious to the audience.\n\nMusic also demands listening skills of the highest level.\n \nAs a TEACHER, my ideas and communications through words, actions, and energy, were judged daily by the most critical and sensitive part of our society, our children and youth. Also my understanding, gained from those youthful associates gave me more and greater empathy with other people. Mentoring, a better concept than 'teaching', is the art of leading students to discovery and giving them the tools to understand.\nPoliticians would be wise to aspire to being listeners,communicators and community mentors.\n\nAs a BUSINESSMAN, owner of a music store and repair shop in Montreal, and as a musical entrepreneur, I have had to develop many skills, and most importantly a down to earth understanding of the need for planning and astute investment.\n\n**3. What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n \nIntegrity \u0026 Transparency, : A politician or a government that stops governing in the interests of the voters and constituents, has no integrity!\n\nAt all levels in this country Partisan Politics and the interests of Parties and their financial supporters, have taken precedence over the real needs of the voters.\n\nWhen the Doer government ( the NDP party) chose money and its own needs over the city... selling the Waverley West lands and increasing urban sprawl, the cancer of this city - I awoke to the abomination that party politics had become.\n\nSince then the over zealous partisanship of 'my' councillor and the actions of EPC, 'The 'Mayor's Cabinet' which meets behind closed doors and returns to City Council with a majority, plus the continued boondoggles happening all over town have motivated me to offer the voters a serious change in both the motivations and understanding of their representative.\n\nThe LAST thing we need at City Hall is a government of blind NDP zealots, or 'Business at all cost' Conservatives. What we need is INDEPENDENTS who vote on every issue in the interests of their constituents.\n\n**4. Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nThe Way 'things' are done. I will use the Bike Path on Assiniboine Ave as an example of HOW the city could -  do better, save money \u0026  actually achieve positive and constructive ends. If the city had consulted with the public, and not gone on a blind crusade for bicyclists, it might have  discovered that what was needed was a safer environment for bicyclists on the streets..   Study of situations in other cities, would have brought to light that a change in the speed limit to 30 kph in the whole area south of Broadway with speed bumps and a little enforcement of the rights and responsibilities of bicyclists would have provided that “safer environment” for everyone \n\nHowever, If and when  a bicycle path is an appropriate plan, car traffic can be separated from Bike traffic with those movable concrete curbstones we see all over town in parking lots and sometimes on the streets. The cost of that sort of re-design of a street is minimal compared with the boondoggle on Assiniboine. This procedure: Consult, Study, Think, then Plan. Would improve many aspects of our city, save a lot of money, and respect instead of aggravate citizens.\n \n**5. Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n \nThe Cities Agenda' Most of Winnipeg problems come down to access to tax revenues! You cannot trace where your Provincial taxes go or how well they are used. The Cities Agenda – giving cities more direct, reliable and predictable sources of funds to run the city – e.g 75% of Sales Tax \u0026 20% of Income Tax collected in the city is the most serious and plausible solution to our city's woes.\n\nBetween this Municipal election and the Provincial election next year, city councillors must lobby hard for this issue. Because Winnipeggers represent 75% of the electorate in Manitoba we can put The Cities Agenda at forefront of the next provincial election. \n\nWhile the mayoralty candidates discuss 'solutions', make promises and argue over details which they have no ability to finance, I'd prefer to be 'straight' with you and discuss the source of those problems and the way we can move toward solving them. \n\nDemocracy was born in cities in Greece over 2000 years ago.

Why did you decide to run in the 2010 Winnipeg election?**\n\nI first ran in Mynarski in 2006 and always planned to run again. In many ways our campaign for change has never ended. Over the past four years our supporters have become our friends. Together [we have achieved a great deal](http://www.greglittlejohn.ca/about/in-the-community/), not just in St. John’s where I live with my wife Nona, but throughout Mynarski Ward.\n\n**2. What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\n\nIn addition to my solid record of community volunteerism, I have seven years experience working for the City of Winnipeg on streets repairs and sewer construction while I was a university student.\n\nI have a law degree from the University of Manitoba and a degree in geography specializing in economic development from the University of Winnipeg.\n \nI have been practicing law in North Winnipeg for over a decade and have considerable experience in dealing with civic matters and other issues of concern to the community.\n\n**3. What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nCrime is the major issue. Many other issues are directly related to crime, such as concerns about the efficiency and effectiveness of our police services, and operations of our city community centres and recreational services.\n \nThe poor condition of many of our streets and infrastructure, as well as the maintenance of our urban forest is another major concern.\n \nHousing is also a major issue as many people are finding it increasingly difficult to meet this basic need, especially low income housing.  \n \nThere are other issues of concern to residents, but I selected these three because they are most often mentioned.\n\n**4. Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nThe economic redevelopment of Selkirk Avenue is something I am committed to working on with local businesses and other groups working on plans for this once prime commercial district.\n \nI will continue to work with others on the actions necessary to restore Winnipeg’s pride in the North End. \n \nI also have a long term vision for the revitalization of our inner city. I would like to see the removal of the CPR yards to begin within the next 10 years.  A first step would be a feasibility study that looked at various options. I think we should build a sustainable community using smart building design for housing, recreation, business and transportation.\n\n**5. Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\nI have witnessed a significant change in Mynarski since I first ran here four years ago, which has inspired me with optimism for the future.\n \nThere are many young families and couples renovating homes and attracting others to our neighbourhoods.\n \nAs well, there is a huge population of young people growing up here who intend to stay. This generation is achieving higher levels of education and getting better paying jobs than the generation before.\n \nThis young and expanding market is exactly what profitable businesses need to become established here.\n \nAs an independent candidate, not beholding to any political party or association, I will put the interests of Mynarski first to build on the positive momentum in our community","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":140,"electoral_race_id":29,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.051-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.051-05:00"},{"id":141,"questionnaire":"**1.

It is important to me that we send someone who is not merely educated and qualified, but someone who understands the needs and concerns of the citizens of this ward first hand.\n\n**2. What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\n\nI will bring my experience of having grown up and lived here in addition to my education at McGill University and University of British Columbia.  Further to that, I bring more than 15 years experience in negotiating between goverment agencies, universities and large and small companies.  I also will continue to maintain and grow my large network of associates that include friends, neighbours, community leaders and business leaders throughout North America.\n\n**3. What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nThe single biggest issue of this election according to the residents, community groups and business owners in the ward of Mynarski is crime. I intend to continue working toward getting a cop on every corner to get control of the petty crime that is rampant in this city.\n \nSecondly, over the years our business districts have suffered and declined to a terrible state of affairs. No one can deny this.  This absolutely has to change. Our community is filled with many young families and those families want to shop local and not always have to drive away to some other area to find shops, services and entertainment.\n \nThe third priority and this is very important to all of us living here in Mynarski, not just other parts of Winnipeg, is livable neighbourhoods.\n \nA neighbourhood should be pleasant and relaxing, not nervewracking, ill kept or dangerous. \nA good city councillor should always be aware of the condition of the ward and everything in it. Including, the state of the playgrounds and roads and infrastructure. A good city councillor must go to city hall and fight for the good of the ward as well as the city.\n\n**4. Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nI would like to change the reputation of our city and that of Mynarski. It hurts my feelings everytime I hear Winnipeg and Mynarski, The North End especially, described with any of these words; \"poverty ridden\"; \"warzone\"; \"murder city\".\n\nThis makes people think twice before visiting here, living here, investing here and certainly before moving here.\nWe have to get to work on fixing that.\n\n**5. Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\nAs much work as this election is, it has been the most fun I have ever had. I can't say enough about what a priviledge it is to be meeting so many different people and hearing so many incredible stories. I have had so many wonderful compliments that I am often overwhelmed.

Why did you decide to run in the 2010 Winnipeg election?**\n\nAs the only candidate seeking election in Mynarski Ward who is a life long resident of North Winnipeg and I have developed a clear understanding and awareness of the problems faced by the residents of our community. I believe I have the ability and leadership skills needed to influence, engage and to be a strong voice at City Hall on behalf of residents in our community. The residents and neighbourhood groups can count on me working continuously on their behalf making the necessary improvements for a safe, flourishing and robust community with a brighter future! I also believe being a City Councillor will allow me an opportunity to give back to my community.\n\n**2. What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\n\nI believe my 51 years of experience and knowledge of working with residents, neighbourhood associations, community leaders and other elected government officials will allow me to bring my dedication, commitment and leadership capabilities into focus towards working together with everyone for a better, safer and healthier community.   \n\n**3. What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nFirstly crime and safety is the most important issue and I am committed to making sure there is an increased presence of police, bike and foot patrols in our community. I will work towards the installation of “surveillance cameras” along Main Street and Selkirk Avenue and in other problem areas. I am also supportive of existing and new community citizen patrol programs like C.O.P.P. and Powerline. There is also the need to ensure better security lighting will be placed along residential areas that are experiencing problems with gangs, drug dealers and prostitution within neighbourhoods.\n\nSecondly I heard many concerns from residents about the condition of our infrastructure; whether it was roads, sidewalks, curbs and back lanes.  I am committed to ensuring Mynarski Ward receives its fair share of capital funding to address the problems as crumbling infrastructure which impacts our vehicles, our ability to get to places we need to go, the value of our homes and our ability to walk safely.\nFinally I am further committed to addressing the issues of affordable housing, investigating a rebate system for recycling participation, expanding community center family programming, renewal of neighbourhood parks, the elimination of wasteful spending at City Hall.\n\n**4. Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nI would like an opportunity to bring back the historical sense of success and pride to Winnipeg’s north end. I would like to accomplish having the residents of Mynarski Ward take pride in their community, to feel safe in their neighbourhoods and celebrate their successes with each other. Our community is full of resourceful citizens, many who have started their neighbourhood efforts in this regard; but they need a caring City Councillor who is willing to work with them in achieving a brighter future.\n\n**5. Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\n\nParty politics is not the answer; it truly takes an independent representative who is able to work with all political parties to get things done at City Hall. This is especially true when dealing with the Provincial and Federal governments’ in requesting their support and assistance in providing funding for projects like the revitalization of our parks, housing and infrastructure renewal.\n\nI also understand being a City Councillor is not for the faint of heart nor a part time endeavor. It requires assurance that your Councillor is prepared to help pile sandbags along the riverbanks of Scotia Street when flooding is upon us. That they will be there when you call for help or come to see first hand the problems you’re experiencing. It’s important your Councillor can provide the kind of representation you need when it comes to defending our community at City Hall. \n\nI make this personal pledge to you, with your support and vote on Wednesday, October 27, 2010 you can count on me being the hardest working City Councillor in Winnipeg, being there when you need me and working continuously on your behalf!","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":143,"electoral_race_id":29,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.081-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.081-05:00"},{"id":144,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":145,"electoral_race_id":29,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.099-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.099-05:00"},{"id":146,"questionnaire":"**1.

I am passionate about keeping North Kildonan vibrant in terms of community and economic development.  I have represented residents as a school trustee for the River East Transcona School Division  for 17 years , and want to continue to represent all the residents and ensure everyone receives the best service from City Hall.  As well, my years of supporting the community  as a volunteer at Gateway Community Centre  have kept me in touch with the residents as to their concerns as well as their ideas for improvement.   I am approachable and available to communicate with everyone and am committed to go to work for all the residents of North Kildonan.   \n\n \n**2. What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\n\nOne of my strengths is my knowledge of public safety and policing issues, having worked more than 20 years as a teacher and counselor in the correctional system. That experience and knowledge will help in developing strategies to combat crime and increase safety.  I also have sound business knowledge  having worked many years as a professional agent for a major real estate firm in the NK area.  As a 17-year member of the Board of Trustees at River East/Transcona School Division, I was part of a team which  lead  multi-union negotiations affecting 2,000 full and part-time employees; and produced  budgets over $160,000,000.  Experience at that level is critical in working and representing the residents of North Kildonan at Winnipeg City Council when decisions are required about major expenditures and projects.  I also believe that communication and transparency is key to developing a vibrant North Kildonan.    In that regard, I am available and approachable to all the residents and will seek their input into the services and development that affect our community.   \n\n**3. What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n \nOver the past several months, I have had extensive contact with the community by meeting residents personally and also by receiving many phone calls and emails.  The major issues are crime and safety; lack of transparency and communication from the City; poor infrastructure of our roads and sidewalks, as well as inefficient snow clearing on roads/sidewalks, especially in the areas with high concentrations of senior citizens’ homes.  There is also a need for more development at our local parks and walking trails; as well as business development including restaurants, shopping and local services. \n \n**4. Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nI will hold public meetings inviting input from residents to hear their ideas so we, as a team, can ensure the viable and sustainable development of the community.\n\nI will work with the Whellams Lane Tenants’ Association to halt development of  apartment buildings on their street. There is an elementary and junior high school at Whellams Lane and Henderson Hwy.  The traffic is extremely heavy, especially during the rush hour.  New development  will add to that issue by increasing traffic.  I am  not against development and will work with developers to locate other spaces for residential units in the area. \n\nI am committed to improving communication and will respond to residents about their issues from water main breaks, road repairs , littering and lack of traffic signs to slow speed on busy streets, to major projects such as the Chief Peguis Trail extension.  \n\nAs a parent and former volunteer and coach at Gateway Community Centre – I know it is important to invest in our youth and families. I will develop additional amenities at Harbourview Recreation Complex such as swimming and wading pools.  As well, the off leash dog area at Kil-Cona Park will be upgraded.   \n\n**5.

I am not happy with the way things have been done in my community and I believe that I can make a difference for the better. I know that it is hard work but I am not afraid. I am up to the challenge. \n\n**2. What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\n\nI have worked in the Insurance Industry for over 25 years I understand people’s concerns when it comes to replacement cost values of their homes, the difference between a tax assessment value and a rebuilding value.

We as a community need to work together with our Winnipeg Police Services in our area to make a difference.\n\nWe need to review the Police patrols that are assigned to North Kildonan in order to ensure that services are there to keep our community safe and assistance is available in time of n complete the Northeast Pioneers Greenway path, so people of the community can enjoy the green space, while chatting with a friend on a walk, jogging or riding their bike with children in tow. \n\nWe need to develop Harbour View and Kilcona Park to make it a viable space.

Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city?

I feel that my present half-time position as a Family Program Leader \u0026 Community Connector for the Fort Garry/St. Norbert Healthy Child Coalition and other community experience compliments and supports the responsibilities that a Trustee would have.   I work daily at a grassroots level with the families in our ward prior to their entering the school system. I facilitate programs in multiple family centres that are literacy based and encompass nutrition, physical fitness, school readiness and positive parenting. These free universal programs are designed for pre-school children and their parents/grandparents or caregivers to attend together in schools and other community based settings in our ward. This relationship is current and allows me to observe and share relevant information that can support the incoming children and their families as well as the educators who will teach them. We all share the same goals in wanting to help our children thrive and receive the best education possible.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI bring a wealth of experience on many levels that would complement the position.  I have lived in the area for over 35 years and raised three daughters who completed Kindergarten through grade 12 at public schools in our division.  I have volunteered in many school initiatives and community projects and was previously part of the outreach team for one of the school's parent teacher association.  My work has involved the families in South Winnipeg for the last fourteen years as a Family Program Leader and Community Connector.  I strive to remain current with the programs that are in the school system and I am personally involved at the elementary level, middle years and high school level in different community initiatives. I have chosen to give up my lunch hour for the past 17 years in support of an elementary school lunch program within our ward as a Supervisor and the past 4 years as the program’s Coordinator.  I also have experience partnering with vital community services such as WRHA, Healthy Start Programs, Active Transportation, Manitoba Housing and Pembina Trails Library.  All of these experiences I feel would benefit the families in our ward if I were to be elected.  \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n1. Forming strong partnerships and proactive support between home and school, the strength of this relationship has a major impact on everyone involved and directly affects the quality of education for each child. \r\n\r\n2. Matching the needs of our growing community with appropriate resources for capital projects and French Immersion programs to benefit students, parents and educators.  Our demographics have changed significantly as well as our population resulting in the need for proactive planning and interim planning that is considerate of the impact that our decisions will have on everyone.\r\n\r\n3. Improved communication channels and clarity for parents with children entering the school system at all grade levels.  With the demographics in the area changing so dramatically the type of support necessary to maintain quality education, as well as to promote a greater parental involvement requires additional strategies. \r\n\r\n4. Creating new solutions to address truancy and develop strategic partnerships that support the goal of regular attendance. Truancy effects every child and the cost involved are re-active and far greater when we are trying to support a child who has fallen behind due to absenteeism.\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nPembina Trails has a stellar reputation regarding not only their academic education but for celebrating diversity and teaching the whole child.  The division has shown to be an innovative leader in promoting inclusion, active transportation and the use of current technology to support the highest standard in teaching excellence. I am very proud to be a part of Pembina Trails Ward 3.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI know the people in my community at a grassroots level.  I know where we have been historically, how we have grown and changed and I understand were we need to go. Having a strong pulse on the current school system and the experience of being a parent whose children completed elementary, junior high and high school within Ward 3, allows me to bring the knowledge and compassion needed to understand what matters most to our families and educators. As a Trustee, demonstrated commitment to the division is vital and I am committed to Pembina Trails. It would be an honor to be your voice and represent you as a School Board Trustee for Ward 3. I hope I can count on your support on October 22nd.\r\n\r\nFor the love of a child, I will be there!\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":248,"electoral_race_id":59,"created_at":"2014-09-14T02:02:01.542-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-15T13:03:41.594-05:00"},{"id":148,"questionnaire":"**1. Why did you decide to run in the 2010 Winnipeg election?**\n\nAs a 30 year resident of Old Kildonan, I have experienced the area’s vibrant and dynamic climate, and feel that this energy has hit a plateau. I would like to renew that energy and promote the area as a positive community to live in.\n\n**2. What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\n\nAs owner of a commercial contracting company specializing in retail professional and restaurant interior renovations, I have developed a great level of understanding of budgets, tenders and open communication with companies across Canada.

What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nI feel the following are some key issues that I would like to see addressed for the ward:\n\n* a. Promoting the area for more commercial development which would ease the taxpayer’s burden on school taxes, as we do not have a large commercial base to draw on at the moment.\n\n* b. Upgrading the current infrastructure for safety concerns and better traffic flow\n\n* c. A higher police presence and promoting the need for a new police district station to serve the area as well as be in a location to easily support the nearby wards as well.\n\n* d. Upgrades to our community centres, development of splash pads/wading pools and increasing the number of bike \u0026 walking paths to promote active living.\n\n**4. Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nI would like to see the City plan not just for the immediate future but also the put fore thought into the distant future as well when city planning. This city has such potential, as was shown in the past.  City Council has to take the step to make Winnipeg accessible to people, businesses and industries. I believe the City has started this process, but needs to push forward and increase the momentum. We have to promote that Winnipeg is a great city and not be shy about, be blatant without being rude.  Support the Bombers, Moose and Goldeyes even if they are a having a tough season, as they are our teams and representatives and ambassadors of the City as well.  Support the galleries, theatre, culture and people of Winnipeg. \n\n**5. Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\nMy run for Councillor is not for a job, but to make a better life and area for families like mine. The residents of this ward require a person sitting at City Hall who will represent their interests and concerns.

Decreasing crime, fixing our roads, maintaining our community centres are all great things. However these should be worked on constantly by our elected officials, not just at election time. In order for our city to move forward we need new fresh ideas and our ward desperately needs a councilor that will put the people of our ward as his top priority when making council decisions.\n\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\n\nI have worked in and around the ward volunteering on my community centre board, hockey and soccer boards, coaching various sports teams and as a member of the GCWCC Plan 2025 committee which helped to set the focus for growth for our community centres for the next number of years. I have a background as a team lead in software quality assurance managing multiple concurrent projects and deadlines.

People are just as tired of the petty repeat crimes as they are scared of the more violent crimes in our city.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nWe are going to add one second to the yellow light timings. We are going to start using mobile radar camera data to increase the safety of our construction zones and school and park areas.  We are going to get police walking the beat throughout our ward. We are going to develop better bus service to get around our ward. As a councilor, every single expense will be listed online in detail so that residents know what the money is being spent on and they will see a lot more of that money being spent on actual ward activities.  I want to extend and greatly enhance the downtown walkway system using it to become a massive showcase for the various art and artists we have in our city.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\nPeople have grown very tired of changes that take place with seemingly little consultation, people have grown tired of hearing only negatives about Winnipeg from “outsiders”. Many new technologies allow us to communicate with residents right in their homes. If we can successfully engage people in a more meaningful and useful manner, our city will start to become the place we all want it to be.

Why did you decide to run in the 2010 Winnipeg election?**\r\n\r\nI am running for office because I want to give back to my community. I choose to live in Winnipeg and North Kildonan and I want to help make it one of the most desirable places to live. I ran for office because I believed North Kildonan and northeast Winnipeg had been ignored for too long. We pay our share of taxes, but didn't get our share of the benefits. With projects like the Chief Peguis Trail extension, the Bronx Park Community Centre replacement, the Northeast Pioneer's Greenway pedestrian/bike trail between Raleigh and Gateway, the replacement of the Disraeli instead of a total closure and the Henderson Library expansion that's starting to change.\r\n\r\n**2. What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\r\n\r\nPrior to running for Council I worked as a real estate appraiser specializing in commercial, industrial and multi-family properties. This has given me a good background in dealing with property matters and a solid understanding of property assessment, acquisition and sale matters. I also did an internship in 2001-2002 with the University of Manitoba's Transportation Institute where I worked on various projects for the province and city. My term on council has also served as a great learning experience serving for two years on both the Standing Policy Committee on Infrastructure Renewal and Public Works and Standing Policy Committee on Property \u0026 Development. Understanding the City bureaucracy in order to get results for constituents requires a fair bit of on-the-job training and I believe I have gained a lot of experience in doing that.\r\n\r\n**3. What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\r\n\r\nI stand for the renewal of Winnipeg's infrastructure, public safety, efficient delivery of civic services and fair taxation. Allowing our roads to crumble and not addressing them will only lead to larger repair bills in the future--we need to address our infrastructure now. Everyone deserves to feel safe in their homes and in their communities--ensuring a police presence in all areas of the city, not just downtown and the north end needs to be a priority. Finding ways to deliver civic services in the most efficient manner possible needs to be a constant process and while progress has been made, there is still room for improvement. Of every tax dollar raised, only 7.25 cents goes to municipal governments in Canada. Rather than increasing property taxes, I believe we should get a fixed portion of the current 7% PST. I also believe education taxes should be removed from property tax bills.\r\n\r\n**4. Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\r\n\r\nI would really like to see Winnipeg's defeatist attitude change. I am a proud Winnipegger and I choose to live here. This won't happen with a single change but from strong leadership. We don't need to settle for second-best. In North Kildonan, one of the biggest complaints I hear is about the shortage of stores and restaurants. While there are limited opportunities to add new retail options due to a lack of available land, some older properties like the River East Plaza (Safeway mall) and the Springfield Heights mall on Rothesay are prime for renewal. I would also like to see Harbourview/Kil-Cona Park receive the attention it deserves as the major quadrant park in northeast Winnipeg. If re-elected I will work to find ways to develop the Harbourview pavilion area and make the dog park the city's premier off-leash facility.\r\n\r\n**5. Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nIt has been an absolute honour to serve the residents of North Kildonan for the past four years.

What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\r\n\r\nThe most pressing need in this City is infrastructure.

What experience will you bring to complement your role as councilor?**\r\n \r\nIn my 12 years on council I have served as part of the “government” side and also as a strong voice holding the Mayor to account as opposition.  Both of these roles are needed.  I have Chaired many committees from Accessibility to Heritage to Protection and Community Services and am currently representing the city on National issues on the board of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.  I was a community health nurse for 11 years and raised 3 children to adulthood.\r\n\r\n**3. What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\r\n \r\nInfrastructure and Community Safety are very big issues.  I would like to see existing infrastructure fixed and see the development of rapid transit.   We need to keep our neighborhoods vibrant, healthy and safe which means police presence but also means crime prevention by addressing the root causes of crime.   \r\n \r\nI believe we must address environmental concerns such as climate change and take action on sustainable transportation and waste minimization.\r\n \r\nI believe we must do something about the lack of affordable rental accommodation due to condo conversions and also create affordable downtown housing as part of a downtown revitalization plan.\r\n \r\n**4. Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\r\n \r\nI  would like to see our city  be environmentally, socially and financially sustainable for the sake of future generations.\r\n \r\nI would like to see a more open and inclusive way of  governing the city.  By this, I mean a more collaborative and cooperative approach by working with neighborhood groups, citizens, non profits, business and labour rather than the top down approach we have now.\r\n \r\nI would like to see a better planned city with a planning department that has the capacity to do neighborhood planning and consultation better.\r\n \r\nIn my ward I would like to see better police presence, adequate investment in fixing existing streets and sidewalks, adequate maintenance of parks and recreation facilities.  \r\n \r\nI would like city council to  address the issue of the severe shortage and the loss of affordable rental accommodation due to condo conversions. \r\n \r\nI would like to see more done to revitalize downtown including creating affordable housing so more people can live there.\r\n\r\n**5. Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI would like to have more safeguards in place to ensure honesty, integrity and transparency.  For example the 30 year contract for Water and Waste upgrades with Veolia should not have been kept secret.  The creation of a new Water Utility has not been properly explained or justified. \r\n \r\nI have called for the Province to create stronger Conflict of Interest Guidelines for municipal governments including the creation of an Ethics Commissioner","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":191,"electoral_race_id":28,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.012-05:00","updated_at":"2014-07-01T12:15:46.091-05:00"},{"id":143,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 Winnipeg election?**\r\n\r\nTo say I am frustrated with how our politicians have been acting is an understatement, blatant dishonesty, back room deals, no consultation, disappearing services, this is not the way it should be at any level.  Aren’t politicians supposed to be our advocates, representing and bringing forward out needs?  I don’t see that anymore, in fact I really don’t see politicians at all, except for that 5 second sound bite on the\r\nnews while the city catches fire behind them.  Well the city isn’t just smouldering, or burning its in a raging firestorm of crime, violence, bureaucratic red tape and mismanagement that stops anything from ever getting done.  My friend was murdered this summer, how many others this fall, how many more before change comes that makes a difference, a difference that we need right now.  Events in the city continue to worsen, and it's drawn me now to focus on helping bring the voice of our neighbours back into the forefront at city hall.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\r\n\r\nI am sure others may bring wonderful skills, but I have to say I get things done, I will work with everyone and I can build consensus to resolve issues.  I have spent a lifetime doing just this working one on one with people of all ages and all backgrounds.  this for you. For 15 years I have served with CASARA Winnipeg, an organization that assists the police and military in rescue operations, the last 5 of\r\nwhich I have been on the board.  More locally I spent the last year on the board of District #3 CFCA (Citizens For Crime Awareness (Neighbourhood Watch)) and helped the start of the new Faraday residents association.  We will need these skills to get our communities thriving again and I want to be the one to do it for you.\r\n\r\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\r\n\r\nPersonal safety and crime reduction are the main issues I stand for. We see evidence of it everyday, so much so we're running out of terms to describe it, chaotic, frightening, fatiguing, exhausting, enough\r\nalready.  Police need the tools now and the support to end this but it will take much more than just money and additional officers, and it won’t happen over night. It will take our own commitment too, our own resolve and our own engagement in the community.  I will help the growth of the WPS community support unit that will actively work with our community groups and organizations to find and solve our issues.  We to start acting now before more of our friends and family are touched by this.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\r\n\r\nWe must have open and public disclosure at City Hall so we can start to dream big again and have our citizens actively engaged and wanting it.  Malls and new stadiums with or with a roof and a public express route to match just doesn’t seen to resonate anymore with the issues at hand.  I want to see the redevelopment of Main street past Higgins, of Selkirk and Dufferin, I want to see businesses return and thrive, I want people to be safe again in there own homes.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments**\r\n\r\nAge is not an issue, nor is rhetoric, ability and the forthrightness to work with the people and get things done is all that should matter.

I am running again, because there is still more homes that need to be built in the inner city, our community centres need major upgrades and renovations, we need more recreational programming for children in our comunity, the rapid transit network needs to be expanded into Northwest Winnipeg, and I would like to establish McPhillips Street as a Business Improvement Zone.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\r\n\r\nThe path from idea to reality is a long winding path, that requires perseverance, ingenuity, and creativity.  I know how to stick handle issues thru City Hall and have an advanced understanding of procedure.

Capital cities afterall are the growth engines of our country!  I will continue to be a strong advocate and call upon the area MLA's and MP's to champion growth revenue sharing for Winnipeg.

Also through discussions with other community members and having their encouragement to run for the position this cemented my desire to become a school trustee to affect change.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nMy past work experience is on large capital projects that integrate with existing operations. During planning sessions I work on how to best leverage these capital changes to lower operational costs. This is tied into a long term strategic plan which charts business growth and associated needs to map a long term business plan. This allows to better identify operational concerns and ensure todays decisions relate to tomorrows concerns. This ensures the best use of limited budgets.\r\nI have an undergraduate degree in economics, a Masters in Project Management and I am a LEED Accredited Professional. I also have numerous continuing education courses over a variety of business categories.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nThat it is a civil right that all children receive the best education possible.\r\nThat there be a refocus of curriculum to Pre-2000 levels where numerous aspects of math, the sciences and English were removed from the lower grades.\r\nStandardized measurement tools be employed and all results be made public. If there is no baseline to measure against there is no quality control of outputs. This is a basic principle of all quality control systems. Once an area of concern is identified, true targeted corrective measures can be undertaken to have positive results at a fraction of the cost of broad based programs. Current broad based measures a failing and are wasteful if you cannot prove success other than anecdotal \"evidence\".  The current changes to the system have had 15 years to prove their worth and they have placed our students in the bottom of all national and international categories. Do we need more evidence on the current systems failures.\r\nI would advocate that current teachers or school administrative staff not be allowed hold a school trustee position. I see this as a significant conflict of interest.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThe amount of good teachers who want to see change but are not allowed to voice their opinion on the matter.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am here to ensure our children receive the best education to prepare them for their adult life and it is done in a cost effective manner. This may cause issues with the current system and how it is run.

I have participated in all facets of education and had my finger on the pulse of the education system for over 40 years.  I was approached and encouraged by many people including many of my University students, parents and colleagues in the education field who said I should run for school trustee as I have so much valuable experience to contribute to the role.  I always wanted to be a school trustee as I have enjoyed such a wonderful teaching career and want to give back to the education system in Winnipeg.  I want to share my passion for learning with the next generation of learners.  I possess firsthand experience in a wide range of educational environments ranging from elementary to post secondary, and I want to share my knowledge and experience with the families, students and educators in this division.  Throughout my career I have sat on various Boards and Committees in Winnipeg, and bring a wealth of experience.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nDuring my long career in the school division I have taught grades 3 through 12 as well as at Red River College and the Adult Centre.  Currently, I am a Faculty Advisor at the University of Manitoba, Faculty of Education, where I help train new teachers.  In addition, as a parent and grandparent, I have participated in the education system from both sides of the coin.  I was a pioneer in the field of Adult Education in Manitoba where I both developed innovative programs and built a strong rapport with learners, parents, colleagues and the community at large to foster learning in a broader sense.  I guided the implementation of 50 community education programs across Winnipeg.  I possess a lifetime of educational experience that I am eager to bring to the Pembina Trails School Division.  My Husband and I were instrumental in bringing the Winnipeg Technical College into existence and we were proud to be invited to their very first graduation, where my husband addressed the graduates.  We recognized the importance of such an institute, as all students need a way to realize their potential. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI am a great advocate for fairness, compassion and judiciousness.  I believe we should try to recognize the value in each child and find innovative ways to bring out enthusiasm for learning.  Every child is unique, and we have to work together to develop supports so that all children have the same educational opportunities.  I am also a tax payer in this division so I am motivated to see that these tax dollars are invested in good education.  I am absolutely against any form of bullying.\r\n\r\nWe are now seeing how poorly many of our students are doing in the PCAP.  I believe that the basics must be taught in reading, math and science.  This should be a priority in the early years of school.\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI appreciate the open and accessible dialogue of this Division and the genuine concern of the parents.  I feel that communication is of utmost importance between families, educators and School Trustees, and I will make myself accessible and work tirelessly to advocate on behalf of the students and their families.  Parents are the best advocates for their children, and I will work with them to ensure that their concerns and ideas are brought forward and taken seriously.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI was the recipient of the YMCA - YWCA 2014 Woman of Distinction Award for Education, Training and Mentorship.  This award was given to an educator who inspires a passion for personal growth, development and life long learning through the education system as well as improves the lives of the students in their community.  I am a team player and respectful of differing views.  I will work to get the best educational programs for the students of Pembina Trails.  \r\n\r\nI possess Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Education, and Master of Education degrees, and my education combined with my experience make me an ideal candidate.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate your vote on October 22nd.  \r\n\r\nLet a lifetime of educational experience work for you!\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":282,"electoral_race_id":58,"created_at":"2014-09-16T00:29:23.993-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-19T11:55:37.595-05:00"},{"id":160,"questionnaire":"**1.

Why did you decide to run in the 2010 Winnipeg election?**\n\nI am running because I’m frustrated with the lack of practical planning and the habit of sacrificing the well being of the city’s people for dubious gains.\n\nCity hall needs to be listening to the people it represents. It should be communicating more clearly on important issues with the public. It seems to me that decisions are being made to support projects that the public is clearly asking for more information on. The Veolia deal as an example. I’m not interested in having more high priced projects, (i.e. the water park), until the places and services of this city are brought up to date and maintained. Quality of life for Winnipeg people should be a significant part of decision-making at city hall.\n\n**2. What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\n\nMy previous work as an Adult Literacy Instructor brought me into contact with a variety of people, many of whom were struggling with issues in their lives that were holding them back from succeeding. I learned to be a good listener, developed a deeper sense of empathy for others, and how to look at a problem from several angles to find the solution that worked best for that person, with that person. These three skills go a long way when you are problem solving and better yet, everyone feels good about it at the end of the day.\n\n**3. What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nMy top three concerns are proper support for community initiatives, infrastructure and the issue of crime. I feel that with a stronger sense of community within wards, and a city hall possessing the vision to promote this, many of the issues we face would be less critical or non-existent. This requires effort on both the part of the citizenry and city.  A stronger sense of community from actively involved residents would have implications on the level of crime in neighbourhoods where people are engaged over what takes place on their streets. Time and money spent at this level is a good investment and will, I believe, be less expensive in the long run, allowing for funds to be reallocated to other city concerns.  Infrastructure is again tied to the quality of every day life for the city's people, whether it affects the roads they drive or bike on, the city owned buildings they spend time in or the operation of basic services such as water and sewer.  We can't afford to keep patching things together-we need vision.\n\n**4. Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nI would really like to see the city develop a comprehensive plan that would address the city’s development over the next 5-12 years.  The first 5 would be spent taking care of the great features of this city that exist, but are poorly cared for or simply neglected. The next 7 would be spent developing a few, far-sighted additions to what the city has to offer and doing those few things very well.  Winnipeg is unique. We should be making the most of what we have because it’s worth taking care of. With a clear vision and a good, solid plan we could be the example of what a healthy, cultured, innovative city should be. \n\nAs for my ward, I’d love to see a St. James-Brooklands farmer’s market. It would be a great opportunity to develop community appreciation and there is nothing like seeing people in your area on a regular basis to deepen that sense of connection and responsibility one has for the place in which they live.\n\n**5. Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\nI am just like many other St. James-Brooklands residents. I work, pay my taxes, worry about my kids, feel like I never have enough time to do as much as I would like, but try to take in as much as I can of what this city has to offer. There are things about Winnipeg and my ward that I love and there are things that I despair over.

I want:\r\n•\tStudents enrolled in the division to excel academically and become well-rounded and compassionate members of society who value each other (cultural diversity) and the planet\r\n•\tParents to choose public schools because they provide top quality education\r\n•\tTeachers and support staff to thrive in a safe, positive, and supportive work environment, \r\n•\tThe school division to embrace the larger community – beyond just the students and their families. \r\nLike many residents of Seven Oaks, I may not have a direct connection to the school division through my own children or grandchildren but, I have extensive knowledge, skills, and expertise to offer. As a resident of Riverbend since 1992, I have also contributed thousands of dollars directly to the SOSD through school taxes. I want to analyse how the school division’s annual budget of over $125 million is being spent on various education programs, initiatives, and priorities. I want to ensure that community members are kept well-informed of the Division’s spending priorities, strategic and capital plans, financial position, programs, initiatives, and accomplishments. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nEducator: During my 33-year career in environmental education I have developed and delivered curriculum-based education programs to thousands of students (from pre-K to university). I am familiar with the Pan-Canadian science curriculum for all grades. As an adult educator, I have trained hundreds of teachers within my specialization (science, physical geography, ecology, natural history, water, watersheds, and wetlands). I am a graduate of UW’s English as an Additional Language Teacher Certificate Program which will provide unique insight into Adult EAL programs in SOSD. \r\nManagement and Policy: I have extensive experience with the creation and operation of an educational facility – including strategic planning, setting standards and policy, hiring educators, risk management, and program development and evaluation – all of which would complement my role as a school trustee. I have experience writing policy related school programming (teacher to student ratio, use of volunteers), human resources (wages, job descriptions), public education, facility operation, and safety.\r\nBoard Governance: I have training and experience as a director on several management boards – including Nature Manitoba and the Canadian Water Resources Agency – Manitoba Branch. This has given me knowledge and practical experience with board governance and the roles and responsibilities of board members. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nAs new trustee, I will delve into many issues:\r\n•\tWhat will SOSD do to improve student performance in science, math, and literacy? Are science experts and resources available to assist K-8 teachers who do not have this background?\r\n•\tWhat are the policies related to instruction, evaluation, and assessment (including homework and student testing)? \r\n•\tHow does the SOSD compare to other divisions (standardized test results, space/student, cost/student, number of mixed grade classes, student to teacher ratio, etc.)?\r\n•\tDoes policy protect and promote human rights (anti-bullying, integration and support of LGBT students, etc.)?\r\n•\tHow are communicable health issues (lice, bedbugs, illnesses, etc.) handled? Does policy respect individual privacy, prevent stigmatization, minimize spread, and increase awareness/understanding?\r\n•\tDoes the SOSD have a comprehensive emergency plan – beyond fires? \r\n•\tWhat are the human resource policies (training/qualifications, professional development, compensation)? \r\n•\tDoes resource allocation reflect the revenue sources for special programs (e.g., French programming, adult EAL)? \r\n•\tHow much is spent on transporting students to/from school versus transportation for educational purposes? Are dedicated buses/drivers used for field trips? Is there a  “Safe route to school plan” for all schools?\r\n•\tHow is technology used to enhance teaching and evaluation?\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nSeveral years ago, the school division made a bold decision to break with tradition and invest in the creation of a natural wetland and prairie habitat on the site of a future school (École Rivière-Rouge). This project – located on the historic Frog Plain – was proposed as a valuable addition to the teaching resources of the school division as well as a community asset. It is located within an easy walk of West Kildonan High School, École Riverbend, and Red River Community Centre. It has huge potential to re-connect urban children with nature (through interpretive signs and activity nodes), provide recreational opportunities, and serve as a safe active transportation route to and from school (once the perimeter trails are installed). I would like to see the school division recognized for its foresight in moving beyond the usual playgrounds and lawns to create this unique educational space. This type of project is particularly important today as most children grow up and live in urban environments. It is particularly important for new Canadians to have opportunities to experience and learn about the natural and cultural heritage of their adopted land. It is this type of vision that I wish to represent.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nAs an education specialist with experience from outside the formal school system, I will bring a unique, fresh, and independent perspective to the school board. I understand the needs of educators but I also have experience from the program management perspective (risk management, cost efficiency, etc.). I will not be hampered by how things have always been done in the past.  I am willing to take things apart (through analysis) in order to create new and better ways to reach the overall goal. Because I do not have children or grandchildren in the school division, I will be a strong advocate for all children. I believe that every child is equally important and that education must build upon each student’s unique abilities, interests, and strengths. As an environmental educator, I have a particular interest in promoting opportunities to reconnect children of all ages with nature within their community. This includes the adoption of natural playgrounds rather than traditional playgrounds, developing outdoor classrooms on school grounds, and developing a plan/policy to support outdoor education. It also involves replacing “fear-based” policies (that discourage or prevent teachers from organizing valuable educational activities beyond the classroom) with policies that focus on educational outcomes.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":289,"electoral_race_id":63,"created_at":"2014-09-16T01:03:54.035-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-17T08:19:56.984-05:00"},{"id":351,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nBeing involved in educational projects in Manitoba and around the world, I understand the importance of the role of the school board, and of the role of the school trustee.

I believe in a trustee role that will represent our families and children. I bring the qualities required for such good service.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\n- 18 years leading innovative teams advancing universal access and personalized education systems.\r\n- Provincial award for innovation in special education.\r\n- Board member of non-profit and charitable organizations.\r\n- Volunteering with Dr. Jon Gerrard in our community (10 years)\r\n- Coaching and convening our community and school basketball teams.\r\n- Great realtionships with other community partners (CC's, Child Care, Health care providers)\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n- We know, watching the reports from Ontario, that 'all-day k/n' causes as many problems as it addresses. I believe in the strong community partner models being pursued in other provinces that achieve all the goods, plus support families to alleviate at-risk conditions in the home. With my plan, our costs and your taxes will not increase, yet our productivity and wellness certainly will.\r\n- I can help change the culture of board secrecy by using well-worn ethical board techniques for transparency and accountability. I have studied ethics in politics and business extensively, with great role models.\r\n- I will tirelessly promote the 'team game', turning WSD into the model citizen instead of the silo it has been turing into. I am dedicated to working with our community partners for a strong and results-driven new model.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nOur ability to work as a team to tackle any problem, achieve the highest results.\r\n\r\nWard 3 is blessed with great minds and big hearts. With our new boundary system, the right trustee can unite us. United, we can shine as a light to the division, the city, and the province, showing the benefits inherent in working together.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI do not have the endorsement of the labour council, nor do I endorse their policies. \r\n\r\nI am completely committed to advancing the aims of our families, the development of our children, and the health of our school division. I am proud of the support from the community for these beliefs, and I will strive to represent you well in all matters.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":291,"electoral_race_id":71,"created_at":"2014-09-16T01:14:22.796-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-29T12:30:50.090-05:00"},{"id":346,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI have always been interested and passionate about education and education systems. To be involved at the policy level would be inspiring and very rewarding.  I feel I have a lot of experience to make informed decisions and look forward to learning. I will be able to represent the tax payer from not only a lateral position but with my experience, an internal one as well. I will strive to be a voice for the students and families of our division. I am approachable and understand what our divisional citizens expect from our representatives. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI have been a life long resident, student, parent, volunteer, Education Assistant and Teacher in this division. I feel I will bring a broad viewpoint from my roles and experiences. I work with my head but also with my heart. I can understand where our students and community members are coming from as well as offer an educated perspective. I have a lot of pride in my community and school division and believe we are first in our class! I look forward to using my well rounded knowledge and skills to impact the future of our schools and the students. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n I would like to see a focus on early education through in-school nursery programs. Early years are so important for future learning and attitudes about school. If we have the chance to impact students in the classroom at 4 years old, we can increase literacy, numeracy and cut down on behaviour issues due to learning difficulties. We have excellent pre-school (0-4 years old) programs that can still support an in-school nursery program. \r\n\r\nI would also encourage better emotional/peer supports for middle years. By taking a proactive approach as early as elementary, as opposed to a reactive one, we can offer programs and supports for students with social and emotional difficulties.  This can follow students into the most difficult time of adolescence.\r\n \r\nIn our high schools, we need enhanced apprenticeship partnerships in our vocational programs. Actual workplace sponsors are needed to encourage interested student in careers in the trades. We have it on paper that we are doing this but it is not transferring into real life situations. \r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nWe have a very supportive division. We empathize with families on school of choice requests, classroom placements and many schools encourage open communication between home and school. We offer students many choices for language, career or university streams and programs of interest such as band, arts, and vocations. We are in the forefront for offering educators many opportunities for professional development and personal growth. There are chances for career movement, and encouragement for added responsibilities within the school. We strive to put students needs above budgets, although this is a reality all divisions face.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\n\r\nI pride myself in being an active community member. I believe when we all work together, we are able to bring many well rounded perspectives and experiences to the table. Building relationships benefits everyone through team work, collaboration, and building comradery. Communication on all levels is important for transparency and building of trust. \r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":286,"electoral_race_id":79,"created_at":"2014-09-16T00:49:50.541-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-30T22:13:49.463-05:00"},{"id":347,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI strongly believe that retired educators are both an untapped and under-utilized resource which school boards need to take advantage of.  Educators are the ones working \"in the trenches\", so to speak, on a day-to-day basis.  I decided to run for the elected office of school trustee because I believe I have a lot to offer ... insight from the aspect of both a teacher as well as a parent.

I taught in Winnipeg School Division (WSD) for 33 of 34 years of my teaching career, and retired in June, 2014. \r\n\r\n•\tThe role of school trustee is an opportunity to continue contributing to the public education system. My dedication to education remains strong. I believe my abilities, education, expertise, and experience, combined with my desire to continue contributing to the education system, make me a worthy candidate.  \r\n\r\n•\tThe timing is right in that I can bring to the WSD Board table an up to date perspective of life in WSD schools. \r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\n•\tI have a Bachelor of Education and Masters of Education in Curriculum as well as holding certification for School Administration.\r\n\r\n•\tWinnipeg School Division is organized into four districts of schools.  I have taught in all four, in various roles, including: Classroom (Grades 4-8), Computer (Grades K-9) and Special Education (Grades 4-6).  \r\n\r\n•\tAs a Special Education teacher, I was the Case Manager and advocate for my students - liaising with: parents/guardians, school team, clinicians and social agencies.\r\n\r\n•\tI've served on several Boards. During my tenure as President of Biathlon Manitoba, a significant amount of time was dedicated to creating and updating policy – which is also a primary function of school boards. \r\n\r\n•\tOver the years, I supported the endeavors of our children in school and the community in various volunteer, coaching, and officiating roles, including biathlon officiating at the 2011 Canada Winter Games.\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n•\ttransparency of Board process\r\n\r\n•\taccountability for decisions, budgetary matters, policies and direction of the WSD board\r\n\r\n•\taccommodation of all students’ needs - academic, emotional and physical, providing the supports they need to be successful\r\n\r\n•\tthe effective and efficient management of resources\r\n\r\n•\tworking cooperatively with and for all stakeholders\r\n\r\n•\tI am interested in both the funding and focus of the WSD Clinical Support Services (CSS), formerly the Child Guidance Clinic (CGC).  More specifically, the wait times/frequency for students to receive the preventative, consultative, diagnostic, and intervention services of CSS clinicians is the concern.  \r\n\r\n•\tStudent transitions from Early to Middle and then Senior Years.  Within this concern is the manner in which student achievement/needs are both communicated and subsequently addressed.\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\n•\tMy family and I have been community members of Ward 2 for over three decades and have connections with each school in the ward.  I was a teacher at Fort Rouge.  Lord Roberts, Riverview, Churchill and Collège Churchill were all attended by either my wife Jackie, our daughter Ksenia or our son, Kiernan.\r\n\r\n•\tI appreciate the diversity of our student population and the opportunity to provide an appropriate learning environment for the success of each and every student.\r\n\r\n•\tWard 2 is a “gift” to whoever becomes school trustee.  With only 5 schools and the Diagnostic Learning Centre in the ward (all close to my home), the opportunities for dialogue with all stakeholders, in and out of school, are many.\r\n\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\n•\tI am not affiliated with, financed, or influenced by, any political party – provincial or federal.  My top priority is that we educate whole students - providing the academic, emotional and physical supports they need to be successful. One can best attend to the role of school trustee without party affiliation working to influence votes on the WSD Board.\r\n\r\n•\tRecently retired, I am able to commit the time and energy necessary to fulfill the role of school trustee.  This is especially significant in a time of transition when the majority of Board members elected will be new trustees and public expectations regarding transparency and accountability are, rightly, heightened.\r\n\r\n•\tMy campaign is completely financed by my wife and me.\r\n\r\n•\tI am extremely grateful to my supporters, and appreciative of those who have been able to volunteer their time on my behalf.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":290,"electoral_race_id":70,"created_at":"2014-09-16T01:06:29.655-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-14T23:56:16.316-05:00"},{"id":348,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nMy original intentions for running in this 2014 municipal election was to become a 22 year old youth mayoral candidate in this race to represent our demographic eagerness to have a voice in the political process.  Like Mayoral candidate Robert-Falcon Ouellette talk about with AYO politiX we need to start challenging the already perceived notions of the perception of how the world actually is. One thing Ouellette did not mention is that to have a perception of the world you need a perspective which is another word for a viewpoint.\r\n\r\nI studied politics during my time at the University of Winnipeg and in my introduction to politics class my professor said this to the class... There is no view from nowhere. What that means is ideas you have in your head don't just come from nowhere. People develop there own sense of the world through education and through learning experience. The perception out in the world is that young people are apathetic in politics. Well I want to challenge that perception by gaining more real life experiences by starting out at the starting position at a grass root level of a political career as a school trustee at seven oaks.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nAs a young person who doesn't really have as much real life experience compared to some other candidates for school trustee that doesn't mean I don't have any qualifications that exclude me in the process to do my very best and try running for school trustee. It is a worthwhile learning experience that can help me educate myself in how the political process actually works and to get involved within my community where I have lived all my life ever since I could remember. \r\n\r\nAs a recent graduate at Maples Collegiate in 2010 I was awarded with the United Way Community Service Award from 08/09 for all the school groups and extracurricular activities I was involved in. I have worked with several staff members and schools board members in the past with my participation on the organizing committee of the 7 oaks school division Unite To Change conference. I am also very well known by most of the staff at Maples Collegiate I was known as the make a difference guy which was because of the make a difference project that I started in my grade 10 year which was about getting students actively involved within the school and community.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nThere are several issues that needs to be addressed and discussed during my time on the school board but as one out of four elected school trustees I don't want to solely focus on the issues. \r\n\r\nIt's about finding the answers and putting the solutions made by the public and community into actual actions. There are four major issues I think as a young person and as a recent graduate of the school division who went through them in the position of a school trustee that we need to addressed are the lack of political education, bullying awareness, mental health, and community volunteerism.\r\n\r\nThese issues have a very important place in my own personal life and are all issues that students are facing during there time as a student in the grade school system and these are important societal issues that should be address as early as possible in the education system.\r\n\r\nTheses issues also play a huge part after students graduate from School. My passion in life is politics, was bullied a lot during my entire time in the school division, also had to deal with depression and anxiety but during high school I got involved in the community.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThe one most important particular thing I apreciate about both the school ward and school division is the fact that the 7 oaks emphasizes the slogan \"community begins here\" which is one of the reasons community volunteerism is a pillar in my platform. \r\n\r\nOne of the ways that help me overcome depression and my childhood dealing with bullying was the fact that I got involved at maples collegiate students groups for example like student council, the maples unity group, the amnesty group, asian heritage, and yearbook committee as a chief photographer.\r\n\r\nThe divisions excels at hiring an equal amount of professional leaders and passionate mentors who meaningfully care for the students educational studies and programs. They offer good facilities and extracurricular activities to engage the students in the community but...\r\n\r\nThe question I think needs to be addressed in the school division is... \"How many students are participating in the community themselves based on each students own merits?!\r\n\r\nFor myself the most important lesson I have learned during my time in the school division was that I love to help other people and to not be afraid to go after your dreams no matter how tough the challenge must be.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":288,"electoral_race_id":63,"created_at":"2014-09-16T01:00:29.509-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-02T02:37:32.499-05:00"},{"id":168,"questionnaire":"**1.

I decided to run for mayor to give back to this city through the public sector.  I chose to live in Winnipeg and now I’m choosing to make Winnipeg a better place to live, work, and invest for everyone.  This means making Winnipeg safer, improving traffic and public transportation, and bringing businesses and jobs to Winnipeg.  The first step is to stop our young people and entrepreneurs from leaving Winnipeg because they believe our city doesn’t offer the amenities, culture, and economic opportunities other cities do.  I believe I have the ambition, vision, and ability to get this done working with all council members regardless of where they sit on the political spectrum.\n\n** What experience will you bring to complement your role as mayor?**\n\nI firmly believe this is a people person job first, so I equate experience with how well does the candidate know the people in Winnipeg?  As well, how in touch is the candidate with the needs of all Winnipeggers?  In real estate I’ve been fortunate enough to work with our citizens from all areas, of all income levels, and of all ages.  This has given me an inside perspective on their needs for safe neighbourhoods, affordable housing, traffic, public transportation, and many other issues we are dealing with in this election.  In the private sector I have also owned and operated my own businesses, as well I assisted many other Winnipeggers establish their own small or large business, across every ward in the city.  This has given me an intimate knowledge of their concerns (taxation, zoning, etc.) to bring to city hall.  My other experiences include property development, management, and financing.\n\n** What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nReducing crime and making all neighbourhoods safer is the biggest issue.  In particular my focus has been on cracking down on gang activity.  I chose this issue because having an area where criminals feel free to conduct their activity while residents don’t feel comfortable enjoying their neighbourhood is a standard of living I find unacceptable.  In the private sector I was able to convert many gang houses into affordable housing for working Peggers, making a significant impact for the entire block.  As mayor I’d like to continue this work with a dedicated police gang unit and a Crime Free Housing program, both which have proven effective in reducing crime attributed to gang activity.  I am also focusing on traffic, infrastructure, and a long term rapid transit system.  Some of our city’s biggest priorities need to include completing the inner ring road to divert traffic from downtown, and developing a light rail transit system.  My other focus is developing our downtown into a true urban neighbourhood that people of all incomes can live, work, and play in.  I have the experience of moving people and businesses downtown and would like to continue this work as mayor.\n\n** Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city?**\n\nIt’s unfortunate some people in our city have a defeatist attitude and don’t embrace our city with the same pride like the other half of our citizens I’ve met during the campaign.  This is evident in our low voter turnout of 38% in 2006.  It’s not that they don’t love our city, it’s because they don’t see our city providing all the amenities other cities have and don’t believe any mayor can bring about the visionary change they desire.  I choose to live in Winnipeg and I’m proud of it.  This is something I can change with strong leadership that never settles for second best or doing something on the cheap.  \n\n** Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\nIt’s up the voters to decide who they trust with their tax dollars and who they want to be their mayor for the next 4 years.  Now more than ever each voter can easily research what each candidate is offering, and decide if that candidate can get it done.  The mayor only gets one vote at council but is still in position to make some real changes to our city.  I’ll also say I have enjoyed meeting so many people, especially people who never felt represented at city hall before or never voted before because they didn’t support any of the candidates.  I’m proudly running my campaign as an independent and don’t believe partisan politics have a place in the mayor’s office.  I find most Winnipeggers want someone working for them, and not a political party when making decisions.

The following is his October 2010 response to our general election questionnaire.*\n\n**1. Why did you decide to run in the 2010 Winnipeg election?**\n\nI have decided to run because I did not like the direction in which the current mayor and council have been taking our city. Winnipeg has once again (for the third year in a row) been designated as the Violent Crime Capital of Canada. This is unacceptable! Our City’s current approach to this and other issues just aren’t working. The current mayor and City Council have said that the poor are not their responsibility. I disagree. Our city does have a role to play in poverty reduction. The time has come for some new faces on city council with some fresh, new ideas.\n\n**2. What experience will you bring to complement your role as councillor?**\n\nI am a recognized leader in my community. I will bring the same passion, commitment and leadership skills to City Council that I make use of in my daily work as an advocate for the poor and persons with disabilities.\n\n**3. What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nThere are three issues. We need to start getting tough on crime while at the same time dealing with some of its “root causes” such as poverty, homelessness and gangs. Crime is not a Conservative or Liberal issue. Rather, crime is an issue that affects us all! In the late 1990’s my wife Valerie was the victim of a violent crime. Gang members had murdered her first husband in our city’s core area. We also need to do some about our city’s crumbling infrastructure. If there’s money for a helicopter and football stadium, then there should be the resources to maintain our roads, bridges and community centres. The final issue that I hope to champion is accountability in government. Our City Council needs to be more open, honest and transparent. If I’m elected, there will be no more secret, back-room deals.\n\n**4. Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nI would change the way that I as a politician communicate with the citizens of the St. Vital Ward. If elected, I would hold between 3 – 4 townhall meetings each year in order to connect with the residents of St.Vital and to discuss the issues that are of interest and concern to them. They would not just be hearing from their local politician at election time. I believe that politicians are to be servants of the people.\n\n**5.

My vision for the City is one, which includes all of its citizens (rich and poor, newcomers, Aboriginals, persons with disabilities, university students, seniors, etc.) I would like to propose that Winnipeg City Council adopt the following goal: In 10 years, Winnipeg will become the most inclusive and accessible city in all of Canada. Adopting that goal would bring out the best in all Winnipeggers.

For the past 12 years he has held the position of Sales and\nService Representative with a large coffee and vending company.\n\nSports are a big part of Greg’s life.  Since the mid 90’s, Greg has\nbeen a very active member in the amateur sporting community in the St.\nVital area of Winnipeg, especially through his development of the\nBonivital Soccer Club.  In the course of his community involvement,\nGreg Nordman has received six volunteer of the year awards from four\ndifferent community associations.\n\nGreg has also been involved in both the improvement of existing, and\ndevelopment of new, sports infrastructure in Winnipeg. This includes\nthe construction of the new indoor soccer facility at the University\nof Manitoba and the Memorial Park Soccer complex in St. Vital.\n\nGreg’s broad background makes him an excellent candidate to represent\nand service the citizens of St. Vital Ward as their full-time city\ncouncillor.\n\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nA SAFE ST.

This\nwill get the maximum use out of these facilities at a reduced cost as\ncompared to utilizing multiple single purpose sites.  Having better\nmulti-use facilities will also help, indirectly, reduce youth crime by\nproviding a centre for sporting activities for youth.\n\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\n\nGreg will dedicate his full attention to his duties at City Hall.

My family has served St. Vital as well, including my father Gerry, Uncle Albert and Grandfather Louis.  I was raised in St. Vital and attended Windsor School \u0026 Glenlawn Collegiate.  We know the community of St. Vital very well and the people of St. Vital even better.\n\nThis election provided the opportunity to serve in a more prominent role and do more for St. Vital by bringing strong experienced representation to City Hall.   I and my family before felt that we should always give back to the community.\n\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?**\n\nI have tremendous experience serving the community beginning with 29 years at Ducharme Agencies Ltd. Nine years as a trustee of the Louis Riel School Board and was Board Chair in 2005-2006.  On your school board I was also vice chair, chair of finance, and chair of negotiations.  I served on the LRSD Policy, Building Maintenance \u0026 Transportation, Education, and Lunch Program Review committees. \n\nRight out of juniors at the St. Vital Curling Club I began coaching and coached in four provincial junior championships.  I served on the club executive and was President in 1999-2000.  I started with St. Boniface/St. Vital Rotary in 1993. I have worked on charitable events for St. Amant Centre and began working with Jocelyn House Inc. from the time they opened their doors in 1984.  In the late 1990’s I developed the Live Out Loud wall climb for Jocelyn House.  \n\nThis exciting event brought together diverse groups such as Vertical Adventures, the Alpine Club of Canada and Mountain Equipment Co-op at St. Vital Centre to raise over $50,000 for a very worthwhile local organization.\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nAfter four elections in 13 months St. Vital is looking for an experienced voice to engage the public after losing a long term councillor.  St. Vital is Winnipeg’s largest ward with issues as diverse as this incredible community. \n\nDuring my campaign at the doors the public has raised concerns around our community centres \u0026 public green spaces, public safety, local improvements \u0026 infrastructure, and traffic \u0026 transportation.  \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nWith the size of St. Vital, it will take a candidate with deep roots and knowledge of the community to tackle the many diverse issues that St. Vital presents.  I understand the concerns of residents of Elm Park having grown up on Kingston Crescent and am committed to preserving the Canoe Club green space.\n\nI have heard the concerns of the Dakota community.  St. Vital is Winnipeg’s largest ward and must have a local police presence.  The recent closure of the Dakota Community Police office is short sighted and I will work hard with the community to restore this service to St. Vital.\n\nTraffic and infrastructure are long term issues that require hard work, an understanding of public finance and long term thinking to resolve.  I commit to meeting with the community to review the existing strategic plan, listen to what you have to say and advance proposals that make sense for St. Vital.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\nI have worked hard to ensure that St. Vital is served by Winnipeg’s leading school division.  I have worked hard to ensure that Ducharme Agencies Ltd. offers the best service and value to residents.  I have worked hard to ensure that we are all served by strong vibrant community organizations that place the needs of St. Vital first.\n\nWith your kind support I hope to bring this record of service to City Hall as your new councillor on November 26. \n\nFor more information about my campaign and background go to my website at: www.voteducharme.blogspot.com","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":177,"electoral_race_id":41,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.534-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.534-05:00"},{"id":177,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Winnipeg by-election?**\n\nI have always believed that we deserve the strongest representation possible, standing up for the real issues facing our families. Our neighbourhoods deserve to be green, safe, healthy and strong. With the problems we face on our major arteries, green spaces, back lanes, in our community police stations and community centers, I felt as though I had the opportunity to make a real difference. If I am elected St. Vital’s next City Councilor, I will put the needs of our neighbourhoods first, and ensure St. Vital is a great place to raise our families. \n\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?**\n\nI have a wealth of experience in the private sector, currently I’m the owner of H.K. Enterprises LTD, an international consulting firm based in Winnipeg specializing in e-commerce. I’ve also been a manager at Convergys, and a fundraiser for Canadian Diabetes as well as the United Way. I’ve also been part of the public sector as an operations manager for Statistics Canada. \n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nMy three major issues are safety, infrastructure and community centres. \n\n1. I want to protect our community safety police stations. They are overworked, understaffed and constantly under the threat of closure, which I will make sure doesn’t happen. They are the first and most important contact when there are security issues in the community. They help to create alliances between St. Vital residents and the police force, and just their presence is enough to make citizens feel more secure in their surroundings. \n2. Our infrastructure defines how we get around and as a city councillor I would work to make sure our roads stay in a good state and I will lead the process of paving back lanes.  People must also be able to move around within St. Vital efficiently. I will push to have Phase II of rapid transit include St. Vital. Synchronizing traffic lights and getting construction crews to work around the clock to finish repairs will help get people to work on time and home quickly. \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nSt. Vital is a great place to live but there are some changes I would to see. First, our community has for far been forced to deal with unacceptable infrastructure in the form of unpaved back lanes, run down streets and backed up traffic. I believe I am the best candidate to address these serious problems. It is also important that people living in our ward feel safe. We CAN’T have our community police stations closed. They serve an important function and I will fight to make sure they stay open. I want our ward to have the finest schools, the best programs and the safest neighbourhoods. St. Vital ought to be the example other wards want to follow. If we succeed in making our area stronger, then Winnipeg as a whole will prosper.\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\nI am asking the people of St. Vital to vote for a strong voice for themselves and their families. We need a strong voice for the true issues facing our community, building better more sustainable roads, paving our back lanes, improving our transit, keeping our community police stations working efficiently, supporting our community centres and growing our green spaces. St. Vital is the best community to live in, and I believe I can give it the strongest voice possible. I hope that on November 26th you vote for a strong voice for a strong community. I ask you to vote for me, Hammad Khan, to be the next City Councilor in St. Vital.","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":178,"electoral_race_id":41,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.545-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.545-05:00"},{"id":179,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Winnipeg by-election?**\n\nThere are a number of reasons I am running in this election. We have seen a movement away from community engagement and citizen involvement. While decisions are being made downtown, citizens are being left out. I want to change that and believe that I would be the best voice for St.Vital because I want to see the future of the City of Winnipeg driven by our citizens’ needs, and not by the few. \n\nWe are also a vibrant, growing community and need to remain inclusive. With our diverse and multi-cultural community, we must remain an accessible and supportive to help our city grow. I have yet to see the city adequately support these needs. Our future relies on our ability to meet these demands and I know I can help address these needs. \n\nI am also running because our safety concerns have become paramount in the past five years. We have seen the police as the only fix to our growth in crime. I believe we need to take a multi-governmental and community approach to in order to help the police be more effective in controlling our crime rate. I want our streets and neighborhoods safer for everyone. \n\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?**\n\nAs an avid volunteer on committees and boards, and as a student advocate in university, I bring a wealth of community service experience. Politics and volunteerism are in my family and I have a history of advocacy and work experience that provide me with a firm basis to serve the community as a whole. \n\nI also have worked in the Health, Post-Secondary, Social Services and Government fields and understand the importance of working with different groups, organizations and people. We will need to work closer with other levels of government in order to solve our infrastructure deficit. The role of partnerships and collaborations will be vital to our growth of our communities and neighborhoods. \n\nAs a single dad of two daughters, I know the importance of family and raising our children in a safe and vibrant city. I have a working knowledge of the safety and security field and understand what we require to make our city safe. I have also worked with youth and know how important recreation and educational programs are to the empowerment and rearing of our kids. \n\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nWe need to increase our recreation and arts programs for our youth. We cannot continue to create inaccessible and limited opportunities for our youth in Winnipeg. This will ultimately help with some of our crime and safety issues in the city. More importantly, to engage our future is to engage our youth. We must do what we can to assure a strong foundation for our children as we move into the future.\n\nI want to move forward our Rapid Transit System and create a city with corridors of transit that move people from their homes to all areas of the city. To effectively reduce our traffic congestion, we need alternate forms of travel. We cannot rely solely on vehicles to transport us to work and across the city. A viable, long-term vision of transit upgrades and alternatives will help our city move in the right direction.\n\nOur crime and safety concerns cannot be solved by the City of Winnipeg alone. We need a forum on safety that involves all levels of government, non-profit organizations, business, cultural and spiritual groups, youth, seniors and families. We can no longer sit by and allow our community to be driven by fear and complacency. \n\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nI would like to revise our transit system so that we can better meet the needs of our constituents. With a renewed transit schedule, we can continue to move people to their destinations in a timely and efficient fashion. Neighborhood and community forums on transit will help address this issue. \n\nOur community police centers need to remain open and accessible. We should move towards maintaining and re-opening our centres with a focus on community involvement and input. Allowing more police officers to go into our schools and neighborhoods will benefit everyone. This will also help move our Citizens Action Network forward with an emphasis on community awareness and engagement. \n\nI would like to see a better working relationship with the province and federal governments so we can address the needs of our citizens. A forum with the all levels of government will help City of Winnipeg come up with long-term sustainable funding to address our infrastructure needs.\n\nAn emphasis on advisory councils for youth and seniors in St.Vital will help the City of Winnipeg directly meet the needs of the constituents. This should be a city-wide initiative attached to community centres or external organizations. \n\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\n\nI believe I am the strongest candidate in this race for several reasons. I live in St.Vital. There are four candidates who do not. It is important we have local and continued representation. We need someone who understands the ward from a citizen's perspective. \n\nI do not have business or political interests helping me. I believe in working for the community as a whole, and want to represent everyone, regardless of their politics. As a non card carrying member of any political party and a non-business person, I can represent the broadest of community interests.\n\nI am also a new, fresh face and voice and not one that has already been driven by political or business interests. We need someone who can go in and work at our issues without other business or private practices lingering in the background. \n\nThis election is not about personal opportunity or gain. This election is about a passion to work for the community as a citizen. We require someone who can objectively make decisions at City Hall while balancing the needs of the constituents. I will be your real voice for St.Vital and Winnipeg.

We moved here from Northern Manitoba over 25 years ago to seek out the opportunities that a larger city could offer.  And we found them.  I have been very active in the community for many years, and simply want to do more to make this city greater than ever.   \nWhen the position of City Councillor for St. Vital became available, I knew my name had to appear on that ballot.  \nMy registration papers were turned in to City Hall on October 18th, Person’s Day; 82 years to the day that women were finally declared as “persons” and could exercise their right to vote and to run for elected office.  I was also born in 1960, the year that Aboriginal people were recognized as persons and realized the same rights.  Running in this election is significant to me on many levels.  I can, and will, make a positive contribution to this ward and to my city.\n\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?**\n\nI am a business owner, a former broadcaster, and a community volunteer.  I excelled in management studies at the University of Manitoba.  I am skilled in managing budgets; have a knack for marketing; and am a dynamic public speaker.  \nMy community involvement is extensive.  Currently, I am the Chair of the Board for the Women’s Enterprise Centre, a board member with the Downtown Biz and Uniquely Manitoba.  Recent board positions have also included Vice-Chair of the Board of Governors at Red River College and President of the Aboriginal Chamber of Commerce.  I have also served on the boards of Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Habitat for Humanity, the Manitoba School Improvement Program, and Economic Development Winnipeg.\n\nI have cycled thousands of miles to raise money for Habitat for Humanity Cycle of Hope, and completed a full marathon to raise money for Manitobans with intellectual disabilities.  \n\nI am energetic, tenacious, vocal and articulate.  I am ready, willing and able to represent St. Vital at City Hall.\n\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\nSAFETY:  The one and only police station in St. Vital is slated to be shut down next spring.  St. Vital needs a voice at City Hall and needs to take immediate action to reverse the decision.  Police presence is essential for all communities.  In addition, we need to expand the Downtown Watch concept to various locations in St. Vital.  Having police and watch patrols in our neighbourhoods will deter vandals.  \n\nTRAFFIC CONGESTION:  We need to schedule roadwork more efficiently, and NOT on two of the limited northbound routes at the same time.  We need to review limiting left turns and parking at peak hours.  Plus, we must consider REDUCING the number of cars on the road by encouraging cycling (when appropriate), carpooling, and bus use.  Currently, transit schedules and routes are simply not sufficient and must be revamped immediately.  \n\nCOMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT:  We must ensure that the members of the community are heard and are engaged.  I would:\n\n1. Set up regularly scheduled town hall meetings to encourage input\n2. Establish a Seniors Advisory Council\n3. Establish a Youth Advisory Council to engage young people\n4. Schedule regular neighbourhood walks and gatherings throughout the full term, not just at election time.\n\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nFirst, we need to address safety and crime issues.  People need to feel safe where they live, where they work, and where they play.  We need to tackle panhandling.  We need a stronger, more visible police presence, and we need to enhance the downtown patrol programs.  And we need to involve more groups to take action help eradicate such horrible living conditions for our poorest residents.\n  \nAs for crime, the federal crime bill has been criticized as too harsh.  The local police chief’s plan has been criticized for being too weak.  We don’t like the status quo, yet alternative solutions are not being presented.   \n\nSecondly, we need to improve our transportation systems.  Rapid transit has been discussed for years now, and suddenly there is a realization that it needs to be funded.  And so now we’re trying to do that 25 cents at a time.  We need a better transit system period, and we need it now. \n\nFinally, we need to maintain and protect our green space.  A recommendation has been tabled to sell off some of the city’s golf courses to residential or commercial developers.  We need a better plan than to pave paradise.\n\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\nAbout my family…\nI grew up in Thompson; daughter of a miner, and 2nd oldest of 9 children (my mother is a saint). I married my high school sweetheart Rick and moved to Winnipeg over 25 years ago.  We had a home in Garden City where our boys grew up, then a condo in Downtown Winnipeg before choosing St. Vital as our new home 3 years ago.  I have been married to Rick for 32 years.  Our two sons Steven and Michael are both chefs right here in Winnipeg.  Steven and his wife Melanie are proud parents of Owen, my 1 year old grandson.

However, I felt the position deserved more time and attention then would be available, given my full time employment.\r\n\r\nSo I waited.\r\n\r\nNow retired, I can focus my attention full-time; without any conflicting time commitments.  \r\n\r\nIf elected, the role of School Trustee will be my ONLY JOB - and not my \"other job\" or \"2nd job\".  \r\n\r\n I look forward to being an accessible and engaged participant in our School Division.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI bring the experience of a 30 year professional career in the Public Service at the Senior Management/Executive level.\r\n\r\nAs the former Director of Finance and Administrtation, for the Healthy Child Manitoba Office, I am proud to have contributed to a nationally recognized strategy of programs and services for Manitoba's children and youth.\r\n\r\nPrior to my 14 year career in child-centred public policy, I was:\r\n\r\n     -  Director,\r\n        Arts and Cultural Industries Branch,\r\n        Gov't of Manitoba   \r\n\r\n     -  Senior Provincial Adjudicator, \r\n        Hearings Board, Gov't of Ontario\r\n\r\n     -  Consumer \u0026 Corporate Officer,\r\n        Dept of Justice, Gov't of NWT\r\n\r\nI am experienced in facilitating change, initiating new projects and ensuring programs are completed \"on time\" and \"on budget\". \r\n\r\nAs our school division faces a decade of unprecedented growth with the Waverley West sub-division, my proven professional expertise in both project development and financial management, will be an asset to the Division. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nThere are a number of issues which I have identified on my website:  kathleenmcmillanward3.com.  \r\n\r\nThese are three of my top priorities:\r\n\r\n1.  I am eager to face the chanllenges within the education system as we shift into a \"21st Century Learning Model\" and prepare students for the future by providing flexible learning opportunities, rich in information and communication technology;\r\n\r\n2.  I endorse an Expectation for Learning; that by the end of grade 8, all students in Pembina Trails will meet (or exceed) the curricular standards in literacy and numeracy; and\r\n\r\n3.  I commit to expedite the building of planned schools in South Pointe and Bridgwater communities to decrease the current level of bussing (overcrowding, and traffic disruption) experienced by neighbouring school catchment areas.  \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nPembina Trails School Division is acknowledged throughout the city as a leader in quality education.  Recognizing that no individual teacher, program or school can meet the holistic needs of children, the Division embraces a collaborative approach across program areas, departments and levels of administration and governments, to achieve the best possible outcomes for its students.\r\n\r\nI would be pleased to join this team of dedicated professionals.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI feel I bring a level of qualifications and experience un-matched by other candidates. If elected, I will provide the time-commitment, proven financial experience and administrative leadership deserved of the Trustee position.\r\n\r\nMake your vote REALLY count. \r\n\r\nWe all have a responsibility in the success of our schools: be it in the Classroom; the Boardroom; or at the Ballot Box.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":237,"electoral_race_id":59,"created_at":"2014-09-12T00:18:49.421-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-15T09:12:07.425-05:00"},{"id":246,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI strongly believe that a child’s education is paramount in helping to shape their future.

My interest was further peeked while engaging in information sessions regarding the upcoming grade restructuring at École Dieppe.\r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nAs a Manager for a large Crown corporation, I have proven to be a well-organized, budget-conscious, leader and problem-solver.  As a volunteer, I have given my time at various organizations and events including Winnipeg Harvest, Manitoba Marathon, Siloam Mission, Folklorama and Barge Festival.

I believe that the programs and policies that we set at the Board level need to ensure that our school system similarly cultivates our students.  This includes the overall safety and well-being of our students and staff and their learning and working environment.  \r\n\r\n2.  I want to bring a fresh perspective to the Board, and will consider different viewpoints to ensure we deliver quality education in a fiscally responsible manner.  \r\n\r\n3.\tCommunication and community engagement are extremely important.  As a School Trustee, I will ensure open, honest and timely communication with the staff, parents and residents in my ward.  \r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI was inspired by the Belief Statement: 21st Century Learning and the Three Expectations for Student Learning that the Pembina Trails School Division has established and published on their website.  These things in conjunction with the clearly laid-out Mission and Values for PTSD are important guiding principles that I would refer to when making decisions.  \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI live in Charleswood with my husband, Chris Fedorchuk, and my two daughters, Addison (7) and Grae (1).  I am committed to our community - to the students, parents, staff and taxpayers.

As a School Trustee I want to bring to the board my experiences and become part of a team to help other families and students find their successes.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI have been a classroom teacher and school science program consultant for over twenty years working with schools all over Manitoba. This has provided me with an opportunity to work with many diverse communities, all with its own needs and vision for the future.\r\nI have been a School Trustee for St. James - Assiniboia from 2006 to 2010. In this time I worked on the Education and Finance Standing Committees. I also served as Chair for both the Education and Governance Committees.\r\nI have served on many other boards and committees including Athletics Manitoba, Manitoba Runner’s Association, Manitoba School Board Association’s Committee on Aboriginal Education, Province of Manitoba’s Aboriginal Education Directorate Advisory Council, and the Province of Manitoba’s Technical Vocational Education Advisory Council. I presently sit on the Manitoba Schools Improvement Programs Board of Directors.\r\nAs a teacher I worked in the development of new curriculum and supporting resources that help teachers implement high quality programming. I am an author of the new Manitoba Grade 7 Science textbook. This textbook has been approved for use in all Manitoba classrooms. I am also a chemistry advisor for a new Manitoba Grade 10 textbook.\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n I believe in a strong local school board. A local school board can provide the best experience for students that reflect the unique characteristics of our community. As school board members, we live in the community and understand what is important to our parents, children and other community members. Programs such as French Immersion, Early Childhood education, and Special Needs education although not uniquely found in St. James – Assiniboia can have unique characteristics that reflect our local character.\r\n\r\nAs a long time educator I am very concerned about how our students are doing in comparison with other students in Canada. The latest PCAP testing results have shown that Manitoba students rank last in Math, Science, and Reading Skills in Canada. In 2010, Manitoba students ranked second last. How can we start making improvements? \r\nAlthough we do not know specific results for each school division, we in St.James - Assiniboia School Division can continue to do what effective schools do. Effective schools provide learning for all students. Effective schools focus on results. The effective school has high expectations, has strong educational leadership, collaboration, a clear mission statement, frequent monitoring of student progress, safe learning environment, and on task learning.\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nSt. James - Assiniboia School Division offers such a wide and diverse range of educational opportunities. Programs such as high quality academics, French Immersion, International Baccalaureate, Advance Placement, Technical Vocational, on – line learning, St. James Assiniboia Hockey Academy, Performing Arts, Cooperative Education, Early Childhood Education, and so much more provide for rich and varied educational opportunities. As a student these opportunities gave me the flexibility to explore a wide variety of experiences that helped me find my passion in life. Now as a father I still see St. James – Assiniboia School Division providing rich opportunities for my daughters to find their own passions in life.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI believe that our schools must not only prepare our children to succeed in our society but must also be able to compete globally. Our country is changing quickly. One of the major changes is our shift away from a manufacturing based economy to a more service based economy. If we are to grow and prosper as a country, we must continue to be innovators. I believe that our schools must enhance our student’s experiences in the areas of math, science and technology. In the early 1990s, I can recall hearing that by 2010, about 95% of the skills needed in the work force will require math, science and technology skills and attitudes. I find it difficult to think of many jobs that do not require these skills and attitudes. With our need to address the problems associated with our environment, health and future energy needs, we as a society must not only concentrate on literacy, but must become scientifically literate as well. To compete and prosper on a global stage, we must be innovators of these new technologies. This goal must start at our local schools and I would support this as one of our new challenges to meet.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":60,"electoral_race_id":62,"created_at":"2014-09-13T02:00:27.104-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-19T19:40:09.374-05:00"},{"id":181,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Winnipeg by-election?**\n\nI’m running for City Council for one reason only: to fix the bus system.  I have a plan to fix the bus system without spending 2 billion dollars. The City says my plan won’t work because it doesn’t take into account the needs of the elderly and the handicapped. I don’t want to sound like the Grinch Who Stole Christmas, but if you design a system to cater to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped, then that’s who’s going to ride your busses. If you want to attract the ridership of busy people who need to get from A to B in a hurry, then you’ve got to design your system for their needs. It means a little more walking and a lot less waiting. I’ve calculated the timing and laid out all the routes on my website where you can check it out at http://www.onforeignsoil.com/better_bus_system/\nYou can also see me advocating for my bus plan on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GDfEjVlZLs\n\n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\nOther than my plan to fix the bus system, I am most interested in finding areas where the existing system of regulations and bylaws creates a disincentive for people to do the right thing. I have a vague suspicion that the lack of affordable housing would be corrected by the free market if not for the adverse affect of certain regulations. And I don't think people should pay more property taxes because they improve their homes. And although I am concerned with crime in Winnipeg, I strongly oppose the omnibus crime bill. I believe all the \"get-tough\" rhetoric is merely playing to the peanut gallery, and the only ones to suffer would be small-time offenders who didn't have the savvy to play the system.\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":182,"electoral_race_id":41,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.591-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.591-05:00"},{"id":182,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Winnipeg by-election?**\n\nLiving in St. Vital and having managed at SilverCity St. Vital for 9 years I felt that this is a great time to try and make a difference.  I believe that we can do better as a council and move the city forward.  I would like to say that I will be a councillor that will be available.  I know that there is a disconnect with city council and the residents.  This is evident by the immense amount of voter apathy, and let’s not blames the voter in this; the politicians are the ones who need to work harder to connect with the community.  I held an Open House during my campaign to offer a chance for residents to come down and meet me and my team along with some local charities and businesses. As your councillor I will do more of these. I have always brought a positive fresh look at anything I take on and doing it on a bigger scale would be extremely exciting.  Even more important to me is getting a chance to make a difference and that would be a fantastic honour and responsibility that I am very much looking forward to.  \n\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?**\n\nBack in 2006 when I ran in Old Kildonan, I ran because I thought I could make a change.  Running against an incumbent, I was trounced but learned a lot about the process.  I knew that my chances of winning were slim but the experience would be well worth the effort.  Being a very successful manager at Cineplex Entertainment gives me an immense amount of experience in talking and dealing with the public.  It also teaches you to manage the numbers.  Both are needed and are key to having a good councillor. When I was in RRC, I managed CMOR, the campus radio station to one of its best years ever.  Being a Business Admin student doing a position designed for CreCom students, this was an achievement that I will always speak proudly of.  I have also started my own Real Estate Business, Osato Property Management that in its initial stages has been very remarkable.  I have been very successful in everything I have done and have done it with a great passion for keeping it positive.  This experience will bring a fresh new look into council.\n\n\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\n\n* Safety - Creating more efficiency within our Fire, Paramedic and Police Services\n* Health - Everything from food to bike paths to eco-friendly options in our city\n* Community - Creation of the Community Awareness Network (C.A.N.) \n\nI will work with residents of St. Vital to create the Community Awareness Network.  CAN will be a community run organization that will be designed to work on Health and Safety issues within St. Vital.  Being proactive with our residents is important in how we go about fighting Crime.  Together we can work on the issues within St. Vital and drive our area forward in regard to all three issues.  CAN would also keep the residents of St. Vital involved in the issues that are being discussed at City Hall.  \n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\n\nI really would like to see more of a connection with the residents and the City Council.  I can tell you that there is a BIG disconnect with the majority of residents and this needs to change.  I would promise to have a permanent office within St. Vital.  I promise to do monthly newsletters for residents to find out what is going on in the ward.  I will also push to work on getting better transit and road work within St. Vital.  The focus on that infrastructure would also include working on our unpaved back lanes within the ward.  As a city, we need to move forward with our transportation plans, ensuring we are planning properly and using our space efficiently and effectively.  This will also include improving our transit system and moving forward with Rapid Transit.  I would like to make City Hall more transparent, ensuring that the people of Winnipeg know what is going on with their tax dollars.  \n\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\n\nI do not belong to any political party and I believe that party politics should stay out of council.  Being involved with a party and having their supporters, you might be inclined to vote a certain way based of party policy.  This should not play a role in decision making; you should judge each decision on its own merit and weigh the options based off of what is best for your ward and the city, not what your party objectives.  We deal with two levels of government and using the same supporters and assets could lead to leaning a certain way on issues.  I appreciate everyone who has put their hat in the ring for this seat, but unless you have firsthand knowledge and actually live in the ward, then you should not be in charge of running it at City Hall.  Last but not least, we need to keep things positive, we need to work together to move forward.  We need to change from going to “Not Bad”, two negative words, to “Pretty Good”, two positive words.  This is what I bring to the race","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":183,"electoral_race_id":41,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.600-05:00","updated_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.600-05:00"},{"id":169,"questionnaire":"** Why did you decide to run in the 2010 Winnipeg election?**\r\n\r\nThe short answer is that I'm running because I love this city. It gives me tremendous pride to call Winnipeg home, but I also believe that this city I care about so much has some deep-rooted challenges that I don't think we can ignore any longer. We need to start doing better at City Hall, and I'm running because I know that a stronger city is within reach if we get serious about facing our challenges head on. We can't fix everything overnight, but we can start tomorrow on a plan to make things better. That's true whether we're talking about beginning to reinvest in our infrastructure, whether we're talking about giving every kid the chance at a bright future and steering them away from crime, or whether we're talking about building a rapid-transit system or rejuvenating our downtown. With some new direction at City Hall we can really start to make things happen.\r\n\r\n** What experience will you bring to complement your role as mayor?**\r\n\r\nI've been proud to have spent my adult career working on behalf of Winnipeggers. It gave me immense pride to represent Winnipeg families as a member of parliament in Ottawa. I know from experience how much is possible when you're willing to leverage the privilege you have as an elected official to work in partnership with people in the community to get things done. I've served as a provincial cabinet minister and before that, worked with a number of community organizations here in the city. I've tried my best to make public service my life's work, and I'm running for mayor because I know in my heart that we could be doing so much more for Winnipeg families at City Hall with a different approach and an open door.\r\n\r\n** What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\r\n\r\nFirst, I think Winnipeggers deserve to know that City Hall is looking after their interests. I've made it a key commitment in this campaign to bring back transparency and openness at City Hall, and that means a number of things. First, it means we don't negotiate backroom sewage deals with foreign companies that would tie our hands for decades, and on a more immediate basis it means a mayor who's out in the community showing leadership, being engaged and listening to the concerns of Winnipeggers. I also believe we need to end the neglect of our crumbling infrastructure and start to reinvest. I've put a plan on the table to do that. I've been transparent with Winnipeggers about what it would cost: about $27 next year for the average household. Those additional monies would be tied directly to infrastructure, parks and public spaces and community safety. I'm also proud of the crime-reduction platform we've announced. Winnipeg has gone six years without a comprehensive crime plan, and that needs to change. We need more policing, but we also need a mayor who understands the need to invest in the things that cause crime in our community in the first place. \r\n\r\n** Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city?**\r\n\r\nIf I had to pick one thing it's this: I believe Winnipeg can and should be a place where people here can go to bed at night knowing that their city is a little bit stronger than the day before. When I think of my 21-year-old son Joe, I know that if he sees his city moving in the right direction and getting stronger day by day, then he'll stay here and enjoy a great quality of life. I want people in this city to know in their hearts that their city is on the right track, whether they're a young family, whether they're a senior citizen who has lived here their entire life, or whether they're new to our community. As Mayor, it will be my job to show Winnipeggers that we're on track and headed in the right direction, and it's a responsibility I take seriously. \r\n\r\n** Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI'm just incredibly grateful for the energy and enthusiasm I've seen from every corner of our city during this campaign. I feel very privileged to be a candidate in this election, but ultimately, this is not just about me. It's about people coming together to decide the future of their city, and it's about the belief that we truly can make Winnipeg stronger. I am amazed by the energy out there, whether it's people on our Facebook page sharing their ideas for a better city, or the ideas people have when I meet them on their doorstep. The people of this city know that a stronger city is within reach, and I'm grateful to everyone who casts a ballot in this election and has a stake in Winnipeg's future.","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":185,"electoral_race_id":40,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.451-05:00","updated_at":"2014-06-06T14:08:26.174-05:00"},{"id":187,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":188,"electoral_race_id":56,"created_at":"2014-07-01T02:04:06.822-05:00","updated_at":"2014-07-01T02:04:06.822-05:00"},{"id":186,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":187,"electoral_race_id":43,"created_at":"2014-07-01T01:50:53.537-05:00","updated_at":"2014-07-01T02:08:37.887-05:00"},{"id":189,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":190,"electoral_race_id":47,"created_at":"2014-07-01T02:14:50.671-05:00","updated_at":"2014-07-01T02:15:00.167-05:00"},{"id":201,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":202,"electoral_race_id":49,"created_at":"2014-07-01T03:29:49.616-05:00","updated_at":"2014-07-01T03:29:49.616-05:00"},{"id":185,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nDaniel McIntyre is a diverse and dynamic ward and residents are looking for change. \r\n\r\nThe vast majority of Daniel McIntyre residents are committed to making a positive community impact and are seeking a responsive Councillor with the energy and leadership to resolve constituency concerns, move ideas forward and strengthen our community.  They want and deserve an engaged and proactive Councillor, who observes and promotes consultative processes and takes clear and consistent positions on what’s going wrong in our area. They are also thirsty for a Councillor who celebrates and supports what’s going right – our arts and our culture, new recreational opportunities and a downtown that’s beginning to thrive. \r\n\r\nI think I have the kind of skills, energy and commitment necessary for actively promoting positive change. It's why I am running. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nI have been a dedicated community volunteer for many years.  I am currently the Chair of the Manitoba Arts Council and Chair of Chairs for the Canadian Public Arts Funders.  I have also been a volunteer with organizations such as Valour Community Centre, the United Way of Winnipeg, and the Manitoba Conservatory of Music and Art. I was part of the University of Winnipeg renaissance in the downtown and West End and as Events Manager, created the well-attended annual ArtsFest. I now work at the Winnipeg Folk Festival. \r\n\r\nI live on Clifton Street in Winnipeg’s West End - a community I love for its amazing diversity - and have owned a home here for the past six years. I have a long-standing commitment to community economic development, proactive community engagement, volunteerism and the arts.\r\n\r\nThroughout my career I have worked with creative, passionate, and committed people from every possible background.  I am a consensus focused, problem solver with extensive management level experience working in and volunteering with education, advocacy and social causes. I have experience in project management and a strong network in the community.  I believe these are skills that can support positive change in Daniel Mac. \r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nResidents in the area want to ensure that our neighbourhoods are receiving their fair share of funding for roads, lanes, sidewalks and cycling routes. The number of our streets in Daniel McIntyre listed as in ‘poor’ condition is 11% higher than the average ward - This is a serious problem and it points to a diminished capacity by the current Councillor to effectively advocate for our area. \r\n\r\nMany voters have expressed the need for greater reliability in city services such as snow clearing and public transit.   They want greater investment in recreational facilities such as the Valour Community Centre’s Orioles site as well as Sherbrook Pool.  \r\n\r\nResidents are looking for genuine leadership to celebrate our diversity and address racism, and take aim at the root causes of poverty, personal security and crime. I have called for the municipal-provincial ‘Block by Block’ program to be implemented next in the Spence and Central Park neighbourhoods. This program involves the collaboration of police services and various social supports and has a successful track record of reducing crime and increasing community safety. \r\n\r\nPeople are also looking for creative ideas and solutions, and calling for things like curbside compost collection and expanded cycling routes. \r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nOur diversity, caring and inclusivity!  Daniel Mac is a truly unique ward in the City of Winnipeg.  Just think of our neighbourhoods - Wolseley, the West End, Spence and Central Park - and the thriving mix of small businesses, arts groups, community organizations and cultures. \r\n\r\nThe cuisine and variety of restaurants, representing every part of the globe and in every price range, is unsurpassed, and is a testament to the entrepreneurial spirit that is so much a part of Daniel Mac.  We are blessed with artistic talent - more working entertainers and artists than anywhere else in the city. We don't like to see anyone left behind and we support one another.  We celebrate our various cultures and practices. Some of our major institutions and local organizations are doing truly great work in helping to build up our community - The University of Winnipeg, Spence Neighbourhood Association, and Daniel McIntyre St. Matthew's Community Association, for instance.  Our area is truly vibrant!\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nWe need a new generation of voices, ideas and energy at City Hall. \r\n\r\nI strongly believe in a collaborative approach to addressing civic issues and my most important pledge is to consult and listen and work with residents to find practical solutions to neighbourhood challenges. I think it is critical to create trust with citizens by acting in a transparent and accessible manner. I would create a functioning and up to date Website so that I can immediately begin to communicate the goings on at City Hall with the Daniel McIntyre community. I will also post my Councillor expenses and grants on-line. \r\n\r\nFor those who are interested, my complete platform is on-line at keithbellamy.ca\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":186,"electoral_race_id":42,"created_at":"2014-07-01T01:32:39.478-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-03T20:13:38.468-05:00"},{"id":178,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Winnipeg by-election?**\r\n\r\nI have always been interested in municipal politics.  I like the idea of making a difference at the grassroots level as opposed to a top-down approach.  I have chosen to pursue politics because I believe in the power of democracy. I believe I have the experience, education, and passion for the job.  I grew up in St. Vital and I am now raising my family in St. Vital.  It's a wonderful community with vibrant businesses and culture, and yet it is also rich with park land, cross-country ski trails, tobogganing runs, picnicking areas, and other green spaces from the Seine River to St. Vital Park and beyond.  I'd like to play a part in preserving these aspects for the future of our children.  People knew me as a hard-working, fiscally responsible, and innovative school trustee. But I was also sensitive to budgetary concerns and keeping costs down. If elected as city councillor, St. Vital constituents can expect the same work ethic they have seen from me as I have canvassed door-to-door.  Constituents can also expect that I will use my passion for city politics to make St. Vital an even better place to live.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?**\r\n\r\nI have a bachelors degree in Public Administration, a Masters Degree in Industrial Relations, and a law degree.  I also have elected experience as a school trustee in Brandon.  I have worked as a civil servant and for over a decade as a lawyer.  I have owned my own business and I know something about the challenges small business owners face. I also have extensive experience as a director managing the large provincial budgets of the Deposit Guarantee Corporation of Manitoba and Workers Compensation Board of Manitoba. Given my broad-based expertise, education, and experience, and the fact that I am a resident in the ward, I am able to understand issues from a number of different perspectives. \r\nAs a school trustee I stood for a number of things.  I was in favour of getting junk food out of schools.  I also helped introduce educational pamphlets about cultural diversity.  I got funding to increase speech language pathology services.  As budget chair, a role which I relished, I was known as a fair and fiscally responsible leader.  I'll use my expertise and experience to make constituent voices heard at city hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What are the major issues you would like to stand for and why did you choose these issues?**\r\n\r\n1. Infrastructure. Crumbling roads, sidewalks, and back lane winter maintenance all need attention.  We need to reduce St. Vital traffic, too, through a) red light synchronizing, b) lane expansion, and c) the introduction of a super express bus.\r\n2. Crime.  St. Vital is a wonderful community; nevertheless there are some issues that need to be addressed.  Having knocked on tens of thousands of doors in St. Vital, I hear that youth gangs are the main concern. We need to fund police budgets and youth crime prevention programs.\r\n3. Green space.  In St. Vital we have it all. We have diversity, vibrant businesses, libraries, and green space.  I'd like to ensure our spaces, such as the Canoe Club and around the Seine River remain green.\r\n4. Diversity. St. Vital is a cosmopolitan diverse ward and we should celebrate that.  Studies show that diverse welcoming communities are healthy prosperous communities.  If elected, I would strive to promote and support programs that highlight this important aspect of our ward.\r\n5. User fees. I've been going door-to-door since this campaign began. I'm hearing that people don't want user fees.  If elected I would work hard for my constituents to oppose user fees. \r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our city? In your ward?**\r\n\r\nIt's hard to imagine changing anything in a fantastic ward like St. Vital where I grew up, and I have chosen to live and raise my family.  However, we need to address some major infrastructure problems like crumbling roads, back lanes with inadequate snow removal, and certainly rush-hour congestion on Dunkirk and St. Mary's Road.  I've discussed infrastructure and of course crime as two of my major issues.  As a former school trustee, appointed director on large provincial boards, St. Vital business owner, and St. Vital resident, I understand city politics and community needs from different balanced perspectives.  As I have already mentioned, we need to increase the funding of police and crime prevention programs. The other thing we need to examine is the funding of our community centres.  Community centres are the lifeblood of our youth.  We need to invest in them and provide more opportunities for youth to get active in recreational programs, and involved in charitable community projects.  St. Vital constituents can expect me to work hard for them.  I will also be attentive to improving the quality of life of families, seniors, and all people in this ward and in the city more broadly.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI've mentioned repeatedly that I work hard.  I am not running for City Council because I want to supplement my income.  I have the experience, education, and expertise to do the job. I have been working full-time on this campaign for the last eight weeks.  If elected I would be your full-time city councillor.  Constituents can expect the same work that they have seen from me during this campaign.  I have knocked on tens of thousands of doors and I have spoken with many people more than once.  It's been fun to reconnect with former teachers, classmates, and even babysitters, who still live in the ward.  And despite the rain and the snow, this has been a thoroughly rewarding and exciting process.  I enjoy meeting people, hearing their concerns, and in a small way contributing to the community that I love.  I hope on Saturday, November 26, you will consider voting for Brian Mayes, the fifth name on the ballot.  I will work hard for my constituents, I will budget responsibly, I will listen, and I will be engaged because I live in St. Vital and I love this ward","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":196,"electoral_race_id":41,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:53.556-05:00","updated_at":"2014-07-01T12:19:09.930-05:00"},{"id":352,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":168,"electoral_race_id":55,"created_at":"2014-09-16T14:26:12.522-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-16T14:26:12.522-05:00"},{"id":195,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nMy wife reminds me that when we met more than two decades ago, I talked about my passion for justice.  I believe in the power of democracy.  I have had the honour of serving St. Vital as City Councillor since 2011, voting to almost triple the city's road resurfacing budget, securing new funding to asphalt gravel back lanes, and overseeing the construction of St. Vital Park's Duck Pond Pavilion, upgrading the St. Vital Library and Arena (completion date 2015), and Centennial Outdoor Pool, while at the same time protecting valuable green space. My decision to serve as councillor is the result of a decades-long passion for public service, ethical government and justice.  As a former economist, negotiator, lawyer and business owner I have both the experience and the interest in contributing to the community where my mother taught kindergarten, where I grew up, and where my wife and I have chosen to raise our children.  I am dedicated to St. Vital and to continuing this important work.  I have knocked on thousands of doors, and I have heard what St. Vitalers have to say. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nSt. Vital is the largest ward in the city, and it has the largest number of gravel back lanes and other issues which we need to address. Having dedicated myself to the role of St. Vital City Councillor for the last three years, I know the job, I understand St. Vital's issues, and I have a proven track record of getting things done. I not only work hard, I bring to the job my experience as an economist and my ability to manage large budgets.  I have a bachelors degree in Public Administration, a Masters Degree in Industrial Relations, and a law degree.  I also have elected experience as a school trustee in Brandon.  I have worked as a civil servant and until I was elected as City Councillor in 2011 I worked for a decade as a lawyer.  I have owned my own business and I know something about the challenges small business owners face. I also have extensive experience as a director of the Deposit Guarantee Corporation of Manitoba and Workers Compensation Board of Manitoba. Given my broad-based expertise, education, and experience, I am able to understand issues from a number of different perspectives. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI have a balanced approach to issues and listen to all sides. I enjoy speaking with the constituents on the doorstep, at community centres, coffee parties, and at other events, and I have listened to constituent concerns.  We need to increase funding to improve roads, back lanes, sidewalks, water quality and curb repair.  We need to improve snow removal, including removing snow more quickly from sidewalks near schools and senior's buildings.  We need to continue to invest in police, fire and paramedics.  In St. Vital we have it all. We have diversity, vibrant businesses, libraries, and green space.  We need to continue to enhance St. Vital parks and protect green spaces, such as the Seine River. St. Vital has a deep history, and it is also cosmopolitan, and diverse, and we should celebrate that.  I will continue to promote and support infrastructure, services, safety, green spaces and the St. Vital community.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nIt's difficult to single out one thing in a ward where I have such deep family ties.   If I had to choose one thing in particular that I appreciate it would be the mix of the old and new in St. Vital.  The St. Vital Museum is a cherished gem, along with the Mustangs, the Curling Club and so many other things. But we also have new landmarks, like the Hindu Temple, the Seine River Walking Trail and Le centre scolaire Léo-Rémillard. \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nConstituents know that I work hard.  I've knocked on many doors multiple times not only during the campaign but also in the last three years.  I am interested to hear and address constituent concerns.  This is the reason I decided to run in 2011 and that I am running again.  I have the experience, education, and expertise to do the job. It's fun to reconnect with former teachers, classmates, co-workers, and even babysitters, who still live in the ward.  And despite the rain, and cold so severe my hands were bleeding when I door-knocked last March, this has been a thoroughly rewarding and exciting process.  I enjoy meeting people, hearing concerns, and in a small way contributing to the community that I love.  I hope on Wednesday, October 22, you will consider voting for Brian Mayes, the second name on the ballot.  I will work hard for my constituents, I will budget responsibly, I will listen, and I will be engaged because I live in St. Vital and I love this ward.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":196,"electoral_race_id":54,"created_at":"2014-07-01T03:05:17.054-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-28T23:25:27.879-05:00"},{"id":199,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nI love Winnipeg and I believe in the future of our city.

I want to continue building Winnipeg as a player on the world stage while looking after the day to day needs of over 14,000 households in my area.\r\n\r\nWe will have a new Mayor and many new Councillors after this election.  I feel that I will be able to use my eight years of experience on Council to mentor the newcomers just as I was mentored by veterans like the late Bill Clement \u0026 Harry Lazerenko when I was first elected.

That said, some rival candidates appear obsessed with these buzz words, so much so, that we have heard little from them other than a misleading promise to \"clean up city hall.\"\r\n\r\nI believe the citizens of Winnipeg \u0026 St. Charles Ward want City Council to take care of business and move this city forward.  They do not want us to endlessly audit and debate in circles regarding our past performance.\r\n\r\nThey want us to fix their roads, sidewalks, back lanes and sewers ASAP!  \r\n\r\nThey want the best Police, Paramedics and Winnipeg Fire Department that we can provide!\r\n\r\nThey want better snow removal.\r\n\r\nThey want low taxes.\r\n\r\nIf Re-Elected to serve as your Councillor you can expect these will be my top priorities going forward!\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nSt. Charles has been my family's home for over 50 years.

Some candidates will lead you to believe that you can bully your way towards change and that radical shifts of momentum are simple.  The City of Winnipeg is a $1.2 Billion a year operation, with over 8000 employees, and you need 9 votes on Council to change anything.

I've dedicated my life to serving people and doing what I can to improve our community. I have served and still serve on many volunteer community boards in St. James-Brooklands. I can and will work in collaboration with others to ensure that St. James-Brooklands-Weston continues to be a desirable place to work, live and play for future generations. We will achieve this through continued investment in infrastructure, community clubs, playgrounds, etc. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nI have served on many and varied community boards including (but not limited to), St. James-Assiniboia 55+ Centre, Silver Heights Community Club, Sturgeon Heights Community Club Building Committee for the construction of our new club, Special Liaison between Portage Trail Soccer Club and City of Winnipeg, Winnipeg Airports Authority Advisory Committee on the Environment.  I co-initiated the launch of a Winnipeg Harvest Food Bank in west Winnipeg that serves more than 70 families every two weeks; and I helped launch the \"Westgrove in Bloom\" community garden project, serving the residents of a Manitoba Housing complex in west Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nThroughout two decades of pastoring congregations  I have served and worked with people from across the socio-economic, political spectrum. I have set, managed and dispersed annual organizational budgets.\r\n\r\nThe experiences gained serving in my work and on the aforementioned boards have provided me with the ability to work with others to enhance the quality of life for the people of St. James-Brooklands-Weston.  \r\n\r\nI was honored to be the recipient of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Award in 2013 for Outstanding Community Service and the Community Service Volunteer of the Year Award, Portage Trail Soccer Association, 2012.\r\n\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n1. Investing in Infrastructure. Many of the roads, sidewalks, sewers, and water mains are in desperate need of repair in St. James. Our's is desirable yet older community. As such, addressing our infrastructure deficit needs to be the priority for the coming years.\r\n\r\n2. Openness and Transparency at City Hall. Taxpayers deserve to know what decisions are being made at City Hall and how our tax dollars are being spent. We cannot have a repeat of incidents like the Fire Halls scandal and the extreme cost-overruns of the new Police HQ. Council needs to implement mechanisms that provide open/transparent communication to the tax payers.\r\n\r\n3. We need continued investment in community assets such as community clubs, playgrounds, senior's centers, etc. St. James - Brooklands - Weston remains one of the most desirable and affordable places in Winnipeg to work, play and live. Ongoing investment in our assets will ensure that our community has the amenities necessary to remain attractive for generations to come.    \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nSt. James-Brooklands-Weston has all the makings of an ideal community. We have a diversity of generations living side-by-side. We have new homes and older homes. We have great schools, a strong, well-established business and industrial community. We have many excellent community organizations served by dedicated volunteers. Our ward sits on the edge of the new Centreport, with all of its potential. The main cross-Canada route makes a line through the heart of our community.  St. James-Brooklands has a rich and proud history and a bright future.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI appreciate the endorsements of Outgoing Councillor Scott Fielding and past Councillor Jae Eadie. \r\nIt would be my privilege to represent the people of St. James-Brooklands-Weston.\r\n\r\nI ask for your vote!\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":192,"electoral_race_id":53,"created_at":"2014-07-01T02:28:39.051-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-06T10:15:41.632-05:00"},{"id":196,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nI want to represent St. Norbert because I know the important role civic politicians play in people’s lives. I want to be the voice for change for our community at City Hall and give St. Norbert the strong and trusting voice it deserves.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nI have over 20 years of real experience building relationships seeking positive solutions. Through my entrepreneurial background and the leadership roles I have taken on, I have consistently demonstrated that I am able to work with all levels of government and stakeholders to act in the best interest of the community.\r\n\r\nI am someone who has always taken the lead in working towards positive solutions for my community. When we needed daycare space, I saw the need to volunteer my time to work with my fellow neighbours to bring about improvements. Wanting to give back to our local Victoria General Hospital, I developed my own charity to raise funds. Wanting to effect real change in our downtown, I took on the role of Winnipeg Downtown BIZ Chair, so that I could actually make a difference by assisting in the establishment of the BIZ Patrol to help improve safety. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nSome of the major challenges facing St. Norbert include: \r\n·      Repairing our roads and fixing our potholes\r\n·      Investing in active transportation and cycling options\r\n·      Creating recreation opportunities for our seniors and young people\r\n·      Improving fire protection and neighbourhood safety\r\n·      Supporting new and expanded schools and additional child care spaces for families\r\n·      Completing the rapid transit connection to our community\r\n\r\nIn addition to these pressing issues my community faces, my neighbours, fellow community members, friends and family have all approached me about the lack of trust they feel with our current city council. I see that trust as the foundation of all other work that our civic representatives are engaged in. Rebuilding the public's trust with City Hall and their councillor in St. Norbert will be my number one priority once I'm elected on Oct. 22.  \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nThe ward of St. Norbert is one of the largest in Winnipeg with historic roots and significant growth in southwest Winnipeg. Within these boundaries exists a tremendous amount of diversity that cuts across economic, social and cultural lines. There is also no sign of slow down; as Winnipeg's population continues to steadily grow, so will St. Norbert’s. This reality means the need to support our community centres, infrastructure and services will continue and become even more important as we look towards the future.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am humbled by the support I have received my community. People have been more than willing to speak their minds with me and talk about the future. This confirms my belief that our next city councillor will need to be a fresh voice that represents the entire ward and bring the change we need to City Hall.

As a long term resident of the Old Kildonan ward, I can see it has been neglected and ignored over the last four years. We deserve a City Councillor that is not invisible, has a clear vision, exudes confidence, takes the safety of our children and seniors seriously. A Councillor that is strong and engaging, one that will return your phone calls because your concerns deserves the ear of your representative. A councillor that is results driven and will fight for the Old Kildonan community.\r\n\r\nOld Kildonan needs a city councillor that will be an advocate for their ward, not swayed by personal rewards or pressured by the connections that would further their own or their friends agendas. \r\n\r\nMy passion to run comes because I believe the safety of our community is important.

We deserve a councillor who has lived in Old Kildonan and knows the problems we are facing. \r\n\r\nI am always accessible, I am available to sit down one on one, but I understand the demands on peoples time so I also embrace technology and the various methods of communication such as phone calls, Facebook, Twitter and, email through my website.

I’ve been recognized by many organizations for the community work over the years: http://janicelukes.ca/endorsements/ \r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n1. Resolving the student housing challenges in our communities around the University of Manitoba. The impact student housing shortages is having on the core fabric of our community. \r\n\r\n2.

Improving corporate governance and accountability at City Hall. \r\n\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nSouth Winnipeg - St. Norbert Ward is one of the fastest growing areas of the city - but we must grow SMARTER and not jsut BIGGER. We must work towards a sustainable and liveable community that provides a safe and secure high quality of life, and efficient transportation system, robus economic development opportunities and social equity. \r\nI have the experience and proven track record of collaborating with multiple levels of goverments and community organizations to work towards smarter development and growth in south Winnipeg. \r\nI am very appreciative of the great cultural diversity we have in south Winnipeg and would be extremely proud to represent residents at City Hall. \r\n\r\n\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI ask that every voter takes at least 10 minutes to look at the candidates websites. To look for the work they have actually accomplished in the community.  Politicians can make a lot of 'promises' - I am more than promises - I have a 14 year track record of extensive community work.

Ouellette will need allies and supporters at City Hall if he is to re-build the integrity of, and belief in City Hall.  Also I'm fed-up with the negativity and \"good enough for Winnipeg' attitude of the present council.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nMusic is a collaborative art form.  I made a living as a collaborator in projects that were far bigger than myself and in which I had to understand the larger objectives and focus of the leaders in those productions.\r\nTeaching is an art form too!  Teaching is all about helping others realize their abilities and potentials.  Winnipeg needs both collaborative workers and inspirational leadership.\r\n\r\nThe only thing keeping Winnipeg from reaching its potential as both a place to live and a place to work is the abysmal leadership coming from city hall for the last decades.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nFirst and most important is the resurrecting of BELIEF in the integrity and honesty of City council:  I will promote a NEW, CLEAR and ENFORCEABLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST contract to be signed by all City councillors and employees.\r\n\r\nWe do NOT have to wait for Provincial legislation.  We can adopt a new CONTRACT for Councillors \u0026 Mayor to sign, and push for the Prov. Gov. to legislate as quickly as possible.   I have consulted with Mr. David Matas, lawyer of fine reputation, and he agrees that a CONTRACT would be a fine start in resurrecting the integrity of City Council.\r\n\r\nN.B.

See their website and especially pages 40-43 for inspiration!\r\nhttp://www.manitobalawreform.ca/pubs/pdf/archives/106-full_report.pdf\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nThe diversity of citizens, from high-density  Osborne Villagers to working people all over downtown to quiet neighbourhoods in Riverview, Lord Roberts, Wildwood and East Ft. Garry, everyone I meet is aware that Winnipeg is potentially a great city... lots of dissatisfaction with the present way things are going!\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nA mayoral candidate, David Sanders has, on his one dime, been at City Hall for two years EXPOSING the problems this city faces that are created by the mismanagement etc. at City Hall.\r\nQUESTIONS:  \r\n           How is it possible ONE citizen can expose MORE of the problems at City Hall that ALL of the incumbent councillors together?\r\n           Are councillors elected to represent the needs and interests of the citizens and city?   or ??????\r\n\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":138,"electoral_race_id":46,"created_at":"2014-07-03T02:04:46.523-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-29T14:39:24.689-05:00"},{"id":208,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\n I ran in 2010 because I thought politics should be done differently at city hall and that I had the best combination of roots in the community, experience and ability to make that change. I still feel that way today. I came within 108 votes of being there to make change then and I am working even harder to be there this time.\r\n\r\nOur community remains strong and vibrant but our roads and back lanes are terrible and the basic city services like snow clearing have suffered. \r\n\r\nI grew up in Daniel McIntyre and I'm raising my children here now. They use the same community facilities. I understand the issues.  I have seen the community develop over the years and have tried to be a positive part of that change.  With a new Mayor coming to council there will be change and I want to be part of that change. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nI have a broad range of experience and abilities that I think are needed for a Councillor.\r\n\r\nMy early experience includes first hand knowledge of the community facilities I used growing up and attending Tec Voc where I graduated as the class valedictorian. As an adult I attended the University of Winnipeg studying Political Science. Working in our family insurance business Home Securities in Wolseley gave me an appreciation of the contribution that small businesses make to the community and serving as a School Trustee has helped me understand the tough decisions public officials have to make about services and budgets. My experience serving as a board member of the Social Planning Council of Winnipeg has improved my understanding how social issues like poverty and affordable housing addiction and mental health affect the quality of life in our community.  \r\n \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nThe big issues on peoples' minds are the state of our crumbling infrastructure, the quality of our basic city services and the way business is done at city hall. There is also concerns that we need affordable housing and a multi level government strategy to deal with the poverty and social issues.\r\n\r\nTo improve the infrastructure deficit we need a short term increase in funding for emergency repairs to potholes and back lanes and a long term commitment to keep maintenance levels adequate. Basic services like snow clearing could be better planned using tools like reserve accounts. On years when the snowfall is light we could set the savings aside in a reserve account and on years like last year with an extraordinary high snowfall funds would be available to clear the streets properly.\r\n\r\nWe need a housing strategy which adds 350 new affordable housing units and a moratorium on condo conversions until the apartment vacancy rate improves. The City of Winnipeg needs to work with social agencies and other governments to address the issues of poverty and safety. \r\n   \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nI appreciate the character and the diversity of Daniel McIntyre. I grew up here and I have seen the changes in the neighbourhood and I have tried to be a positive part of that change.  I want my children to grow up in the same strong and vibrant community that I did and I want Winnipeg to be a strong and vibrant city . \r\n\r\nDaniel McIntyre has a mixture of people from different cultural and economic backgrounds and that makes it a great place to live and raise our children. I want to do my part to keep it moving forward.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nThis election is important. We are going to have a new Mayor and we need to do things differently at city hall. I don't believe in party politics at city hall and I will work with the new Mayor and whoever is elected to council in an effort to keep Daniel McIntyre a strong and vibrant community in a strong and vibrant Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nI have a good understanding of the community and the experience needed to make the tough choices.\r\n\r\nMy approach to problem solving is no nonsense but collaborative and cooperative. I will use my best judgement in what I believe is in the best interest of Daniel McIntyre and the city of Winnipeg and I will be transparent and accountable. \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":129,"electoral_race_id":42,"created_at":"2014-07-05T00:05:16.727-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-13T18:19:48.423-05:00"},{"id":205,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\n A strong knowledgable, talented, well grounded councillor group can support a good Mayor and their agenda or buffer and hold a poor Mayor in check from damaging the City and it finances/Credit Rating. A good councillor group can enhance the platform for the Mayor by bringing their own viable fresh ideas to the table for consideration as well. I wanted to bring my expertise to the council table and see if I can be a positive influence to turn the City back towards good governance, be progressive but with sound values and cost control and put my experience and skillset to good use.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nI believe my senior management expertise and leadership which was built from the ground floor up to Director level in a medium sized business as well as my budgeting and analytic knowledge,common sense, and strong grasp of civic affairs gives me the tools necessary to become a good councillor. My writing and speaking skills are sound as is my negotiating and debating skillset. With many years of business experience I have the ability to quickly analyze the pros and cons of an issue and come up with viable and leading edge solutions. I have an extremely diverse background in business and I have had up to 300 people directly report to me.I have had very diifferent and varied areas of responsibility over those years in various areas of the company. I was fortunate to be asked by ownership on many occasions to go in,analyze, find solution. then implement, reorganize/streamline and improve results by quickly picking up and running with it. City Hall will be another task similar to others I have taken on before but on a grander but still controllable scale.  \r\n\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI have a platform of over 70 items, many very unique and original, that will improve the services of and the City for the benefit of the citizens without costing a lot of money, have other items that will save money and many items to control costs as well. I also have an infastructure platform as well on how to afford to and fix our roads.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nThis Ward is extemely diverse from suburbia to some very challenged areas with a huge multi-cultural melting pot which gives it a special place versus some of the other Wards in City The Ward also encompasses much of old Winnipeg and the downtown area which are posed for renewal now and in the next decade.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nEveryone knows the City has it challenges and agrees that changes are needed and that many things need to be improved upon or fixed. My proven business track record, my knowledge of the issues, Civic affairs, my common sense, and my skills and knowledge base will play a strong role in providing the solutions that sets me apart from other candidates in the Ward. All candidates want to and are running to improve the City but not everone has skills nor experience needed to understand, develop a plan, and then execute to get the many tasks done that will be needed to be completed in the next 4 years . I believe I have a proven track record and I can hit the ground running if elected with a strong platform and will lead not follow towards improving the City.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":204,"electoral_race_id":49,"created_at":"2014-07-03T02:13:56.664-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-29T17:35:51.544-05:00"},{"id":206,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nAfter spending many years as a community activist, I feel comfortable asking all the people of St. James Brooklands Weston for the opportunity to be their Councillor. I successfully presented a petition about keeping the Eldon Ross Pool open year round. Although it took 2 years too long, I was active in getting the demolition site at 2093 Portage Avenue cleaned up. Also, I have spoken up on issues concerning the barricade at Logan and McPhillips, the problems dealing with the construction of the new St. James Fire Hall, safety issues at Mount Royal and Ness, infill housing issues on Parkview Street, and the over development of the Silver Heights Collegiate site. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nDuring my 18 years as a courier, I got to know the entire City. I have spent 15 years in the management of restaurants. As a parent and grandparent, I have seen the importance of proper recreational facilities. My life long passion for politics will help me be a Councillor.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nAs we face a large infrastructure deficit, it is important that Councillors spend their Ward Allowances responsibly. I will stop all spending on bus benches, luncheons, advertising, periodicals, and service club memberships. The most important current  issue in our ward is the mess in East St. James. Although the various construction project were necessary, there has been little or no explanation from the City about why these projects have taken so long? Did we have several neighbouring street closed at the same time? \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nThe history of the ward . It is important to appreciate the efforts of those who have come before us.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nAn immediate priority for the City is to monitor the Frozen Pipes issues. The statistics should be posted on the City Web Site twice a week every winter. If we have a recurrence of last winter's problem, it will easily  recognised by Councillors and put on the agenda of Council. Council and Committee meetings should be held in the evening in order to give people a chance to attend. Community Committee Meetings should be held in the Community.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":163,"electoral_race_id":53,"created_at":"2014-07-04T01:15:23.596-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-30T11:54:26.471-05:00"},{"id":211,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nI am running to improve city services.  \r\n\r\nCurrently we face several crises in North Kildonan that I list in no particular order:  Contaminated water,  Crumbling streets, Police Station closures, Leased libraries, Lack of express busing, Inability to clear snow; need for more community club services (parent groups, clubs for youth, employability skills training), ill managed traffic flow.  \r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nI have worked with the construction trades, the retail industry, various social services; several educational institutions.  I have been a Coordinator/Chair with MB Justice, MB Children and Youth Opportunities and MB Tourism/Ont. Tourism; Carpenter's Helper in 3 provinces; a GM Manager with Extra Foods; Dept. Manager with Palliser; Store Manager CWB; I currently manage an all French library and represent the Computer and Library Techs as a Councillor for Manitoba's 3rd largest employer. I have been a Community Correspondent for the Herald since 2012. I have volunteered as a Youth Program Coordinator, Co-chair of the River East Neighbourhood Network and Firefighter.      \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nLeadership: Our current council was not able to ask the right questions to save us millions of dollars in real estate transactions. The past ten years we have lived without Kilcona or Chornick Park, we have lost our police station, we have had constant brown water, we have sold off our garbage collectors, snow removers and street repair teams because no one could or had the will to manage them-the problems persist all the way from Shoal Lake to Lake Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nOwnership: Why do we lease the Henderson Library from a leasing agency for $45,000 a month and why does that same agency donate money to our city politicians? We would be wise to own our permanent buildings for the same reasons that we own our homes if not only for transparency.\r\n\r\nCommunity health: Our neighbourhoods need organized programming for families-there is a lot more that we could be doing in our NK Community Centers. I would like to see our neighbourhoods as active as possible.\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nThe people of North Kildonan genuinely care.  I have spent many years in North Kildonan and will be raising our family here.  One constant since my youth that I have noticed is that so many families retire here for the same reasons they raised their children in this part of the city.  We are inundated with the natural beauty of parks and rivers, trees and sky. We are close to downtown but once home we are in our own neighbourhood.  We care about our public spaces as we care for our properties and we truly care for one another. As a Councillor it is important to know while we manage city policies to improve public services-we are protecting and enhancing this healthy and safe environment in which we live.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":207,"electoral_race_id":43,"created_at":"2014-07-05T00:34:45.146-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-01T12:31:26.536-05:00"},{"id":210,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nI felt that it was time for a truly independent candidate to be an option for voters free of business, personal or special interests.

I can also apply my goal setting and accountability ethics learned over the course of my entire 20 year career in sales and management.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nFiscal responsibility is a main one as it applies to almost everything we do in city operations.  Communication is major as well as that has been identified as a point of contention for the residents so far during the campaign.  I would also like to see a sensible, cost-effective solution to our transit issues developed.  On a local level, looking at our community amenities in the ward to see where improvements can be made for community centres, active transportation options and even dog parks.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nIt feels like home.

I have given my time and energy on a variety of local initiatives. I have volunteered at Folklorama, fundraised for the St. Boniface Cathedral and built homes for the community with Habitat for Humanity. As President of my residents’ association, I spoke on behalf of my neighbourhood, an experience I know will be valuable when representing all of the St. Boniface Ward. As CEO of the Francophone Chamber of Commerce of St. Boniface, I brought St. Boniface businesses together within the business environment. I fostered valuable relationships there which, as a councillor, I can use this experience to bring business and community together. Finally, as a small business owner, I know what businesses need from the city to succeed.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nOur campaign has four priorities - the four priorities that voters have repeatedly identified on the thousands of doorsteps that I’ve visited. If elected, I will work from day one on the four priorities I have clearly identified over the course of my campaign.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Winnipeg have lost confidence in City Hall. Accountability must be restored in our civic government before the voters can trust the city to tackle our infrastructure challenges in St. Boniface and Winnipeg at-large. We must find creative ways to deal with these infrastructure challenges immediately.\r\n\r\nYet these larger questions should not overshadow the number of local priorities that voters have identified. As your neighbour and your councillor, I will get results. I have a proven track record of bringing business and community together. Through my work with the Francophone Chamber of Commerce and my residents association, and many other local initiatives, I have proven that I have the skills required to bring diverse interests together to deliver the best results.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nWhat I love most about St. Boniface is our neighbours’ community spirit:\r\n* Frank Capasso from Sage Creek, who is building a park for future generations.\r\n* Dee Dee Budgell in Royalwood who is an active community volunteer, and my official agent.\r\n* Lindsey Wilson, president of Island Lakes residents association, who stands on guard for his neighbourhood \r\n* Dany Robidoux from Southdale helps municipalities across Manitoba embrace the green economy\r\n* Ben Brisebois from Windsor Park, volunteer and social media master on my own campaign \r\n* Dave Angus in Southland Park, who works for a better business environment in Winnipeg\r\n* Mamadou Ka in Norwood, president of the Franco-Manitoban Society \r\n* Natalie Gerard, a new Canadian from France who chose to make her home in Old St. Boniface \r\nI love the diversity and community spirit embodied by just this small sample of our neighbours. I plan to channel this neighbourly spirit as your councillor.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nSt. Boniface is my life.\r\n\r\nIt’s where, during my campaign, I met Mr. Roy who asked me: “Are you the little boy who used to run down this street? Your dad said you could run up to this pole, but you had to turn around.”\r\n\r\nIt’s where I fell in love with my wife Joelle at the age of 17.

My heart brought me here and I have enjoyed tremendous professional and personal success since then, ultimately finding the love of my life and starting a family with her. It is not a decision I ever second-guess.\r\n\r\nBut if that same dilemma was presented today, only eleven years later, I'm not so sure that it's as easy a decision to reach. That frustrates me as I want our City to remain attractive to outsiders. I want our City to remain attractive to those of us who already live here. I know far too many friends who have departed in recent years and I believe we need some strong leadership to address the issues holding us back.\r\n\r\nAnd I also believe it is important that you can't just stand on the sidelines when you truly believe something needs to be fixed, as City Hall and our broken streets do now. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nI have spent the last year working for another city councillor watching and learning how City Hall governance functions. I was there for all three of the independent audits into real estate, fire halls and police headquarters. I have experience helping residents through some of the infrastructure issues which have been plaguing our city including brown water, frozen pipes, and last winter's shoddy snow clearing efforts. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I have been actively involved in politics for 20 years as both a volunteer, organizer, and researcher. No matter the party, people who work to support our political system gain a keen insight into public policy decision making.\r\n\r\nI didn't start thinking about how to make Winnipeg a better city when I registered to run; I have been thinking, writing, and debating about civic issues for years.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nAfter a decade of megaprojects, the next large scale project must be street renewal. The infrastructure debt is very real and seen every day on our streets. This is the biggest issue facing our next council.\r\n\r\nWe need more seniors housing to help an aging population remain in our community. I will work with residents and developers to find solutions that fit with the character of our well-established neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\nTransparency, fairness, and accountability must return to City Hall. We cannot let the scandals that have been unearthed over the past few years ever happen again. Senior city administration needs to know that backroom deals and massive cost overruns will carry serious consequences.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nThe strong inherent sense of community that each of the three communities in the ward have. There is a distinct feel to each of Charleswood, Tuxedo, and Whyte Ridge that makes me excited about the prospect of representing this ward at City Hall.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nIts a cliche, but I have loved the time spent meeting the many people throughout the ward who help make Winnipeg the wonderful place that it is. The way people share their thoughts and ideas has been a terrific experience. I'm running on minimal sleep, in a constant flurry of activity, and think this is the best job interview I could ever ask for.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":205,"electoral_race_id":44,"created_at":"2014-07-04T23:49:10.484-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-09T23:15:33.626-05:00"},{"id":122,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nI decided to run for Mayor because I could see the mismanagement and waste occurring at city hall, all the while, taxes going up to pay for it. As a City Councillor, I became more frustrated and outspoken about the lack of respect citizens were receiving. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Mayor?\n\nI have experience as a City Councillor. This is incredibly important because I understand and have working knowledge of every department and the people who work in them, the budget process and the status of many unfinished items. I hold an MBA and a BA and have worked in both private and public sectors. I know how to do more with less as a single mother with two boys.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Mayor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n1. Restore trust and confidence in City Hall by implementing the audit recommendations and cleaning up the mess. I was very vocal about the need for these audits. They showed incompetence, mismanagement and the RCMP is reviewing it.\r\n2. Fix the roads because they're a disgrace and indicative of what went in in number 1 above.\r\n3. Strive to build vibrancy and create opportunities for everyone to succeed.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the City of Winnipeg?\n\nI love our city. One thing I appreciate is that probably 90% if the City of Winnipeg workforce wants to make Winnipeg be a better place for everyone and they choose public service.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am the best candidate for Mayor because I have municipal experience and I did NOT accept the status quo in my time on Council. If we are to fix what's wrong, one has to know what's going on. Being the Mayor of a city is not an entry level job. You deserve someone who will get right to work and who knows what to do to make our city be an inspiration-to those who built it, those who are deciding whether to live here and to get the best value for what citizens pay.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":10,"electoral_race_id":2,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:52.824-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-19T07:38:56.618-05:00"},{"id":9,"questionnaire":"**Why did you decide to run in the 2010 Winnipeg election?**\r\n\r\nI am running for City Council because I am a person of action and I want to make a significant contribution to improve our ward and our city.

For far too long I have seen inaction, roadblocks and excuses as to why action can not be done to improve the City.  I have seen a lot of finger pointing in all directions except the direction that it should be, and that is at City Council.  I have decided it is time to step up, take action and run for council.  Change needs to happen and I hope to bring that change in, that is why I decided to run.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nHaving worked for the City for over 28 years, I can say my experience is vast.  Working in Departments such as Winnipeg Transit and now Public Works, I can say I do have great knowledge and appreciation for the workings within the City.  I have experienced first hand the front line issues the City is faced with and the need to fix a system that is broken.  Working as a mechanic at Transit, I have dealt with the public on many different fronts.  I have experienced the troubles plaguing the system that prevents people from moving on our buses in an efficient manner.\r\nAs a Safety Technician for Public Works, I deal with all levels of employees from the worker fixing your potholes, to managers ensuring service gets to the people that need it the most.  I deal with policy, by-laws and guidelines that help ensure the citizens of Winnipeg are safe during our construction season.  \r\nAs for education, I have been educated at University of Manitoba in Maths and Sciences, I have 2 Certifications from Red River College and a vast array of training provided by various organizations including the City of Winnipeg and Province of Manitoba.\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nTransparency is a big one, information should be readily available to all citizens who ask.  Contracts should not be secret.  The citizens shouldnt know how much a contractor pays its employees but the citizens should have the right to know how much the contract is costing the City.\r\nThe citizens should also know how councillors vote on an issue, that should be made public.\r\n\r\nAccountability is another issue that is lacking and I would like to bring that back.  We need to stand up for what we did, good or bad, and be held accountable for our actions.\r\n\r\nThese issues are big ones for me.  For far too long City Council has been pointing fingers, finding scape goats and performing a smoke and mirror show.  We need to fix our own problems and not rely on the Province, or blame the Province or blame anyone else for that matter.  It is soley because of the lack of accountability that we are in the mess we are in.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nI appreciate the people.  We have a large diverse population in the Charleswood Tuxedo Whyte Ridge ward and they are all equally wonderful.  I have volunteered with many groups, school councils, football clubs, and environmental groups.  I have always enjoyed the people that have stepped up to help, always appreciated the willingness to help when help is needed.  I am sure that my area is not unique to this but it is something I have grown to appreciate.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nThroughout this campaign I have always failed to state the obvious.  I dont want to bore people with \"fix the roads\".  \r\nI encourage people to ask questions, think for themselves and challenge all those running for council.  Think outside the box and dont just settle for the same old thing we have.  The same old thing isnt working anymore.\r\nI am a hands on person and if I am elected I will ensure to remain hands on where it is needed.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":224,"electoral_race_id":44,"created_at":"2014-08-29T01:14:28.975-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-01T13:15:20.597-05:00"},{"id":308,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nMy vision is one where all the stakeholders’ issues are resolved in an open pragmatic dialogue. Ideology needs to be kept out of the Board of Trustees, as our children’s future and all of the stakeholders’ futures rest upon making the best decisions.   I believe in building community consensus, where opponents and proponents of the issues work together to produce motions to the board.  The Winnipeg School Division belongs to all the residents within its boundaries, and they all should be represented.\r\nI have regularly followed the Winnipeg School Division’s Board of Trustees meetings, policies, and general conduct.  The lack of recorded votes, the over use of in camera meetings, the policy choices, and the lack of real public input needs to change.   \r\nI am ready to work as a school trustee on many fronts and issues: to vote for recorded votes; to vote for less closed door meetings, to maintain lower taxes, to make decisions that are in all the stakeholders (children, parents, taxpayer, educators, and societies) best interests not for politicking or personal gain, and mostly to ensure our children receive the best possible education. \r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI am a small business owner, educated in Business Administration from Red River College.  I have controlled large budgets in two heating ventilation and air conditioning businesses as an owner, and in a beauty supply company as a shareholder.  I am experienced in finance, accounting, and management, from owning three businesses.  Finance is very different when it’s your money that is being spent.   I sold one of the businesses in 2011, this allows be the time to be a great trustee. I have researched frame funding and have a good knowledge of its mechanisms.   My business background would be an asset for the financial operations of the Winnipeg School Division\r\nI have my Red Seal Journey person status in Air Conditioning and Refrigeration, gas fitters license, and an electrical license. My familiarity of building construction, mechanical systems, and the operations and maintenance of buildings would be valuable on the Building/Transportation Committee.\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nThe taxpayer has to be recognized as partner in the public school system and needs to have predictable school tax rates.  Adding all day nursery kindergarten will increase taxes up to 17% when fully implemented as the provincial government has not committed to funding it.  I believe the taxpayer needs tax increases to remain within the rate of inflation.  The provincial government’s recent increases in the Education Property Tax Credit should not be erased by the Board of Trustees.\r\nI am a parent of a special needs child, and I am supportive of practical initiatives to improve the education and care of these children. I support inclusion into regular school programming for special needs children.  The Special needs programs provided by WSD are exceptional, and I believe the residents of WSD are proud of their accomplishments.  I want to ensure the continuation of these valuable programs.\r\nInclusion for me includes diversity and respect of each other, I support in anti-homophobia legislation.  I support the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and support the existing human rights and anti-homophobia initiatives of the Winnipeg School Division. We need to give children a world where they can be safe, accepted, and successful.\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI have lived in the River Heights- Crescentwood neighborhood since 1967, attending Robert H. Smith, Ecole River Heights, Kelvin, and graduating from Grant Park School in 1982.  I am married to my wife for 18 years, and our 2 children attend school in the division with my son at Grant Park High School, and my daughter at Lord Roberts Elementary School.  \r\nOur daughter has mild seizures, and we have peace of mind knowing that the staff at Lord Roberts School will meet any needs that she will have.  You can sense and see that the staff cares about children.  There are many great staff members employed by the division, in all areas including; Principals, Teachers, Education Assistants, Therapist, Administration, Reading Clinicians, Psychologists, IT, Custodial, Building Services, and many other occupations.   \r\nThe Winnipeg School Division has a rich history with my family, my late father graduated from Isaac Newton in 1941.  It would be a honor to serve the public, and to return the schools back to the all of the public.\r\n\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nThe residents and voters of River Heights have a higher than average turnout at elections.  They research the candidates before making their voting decision and tend to make smart choices.  The River Heights voters are center and center right, a place that I am on the political spectrum.  I became a Progressive Conservative member in 2011, after the P.S.T. increase.  The increase was a disappointment in that the government promised not to raise the tax, and then bypassed the referendum legislation.  I believe that Liberals and Progressive Conservatives have the best policies and platforms.  I believe many people in River Heights do not favor labor endorsed candidates, and prefer the center.

I'm running because I believe this city needs new, energetic leadership to continue to move us forward.  We need a new approach.  \r\n\r\nI believe I can bring positive change to City Hall by being the kind of councillor that:\r\n\r\n- is accountable to my constituents by engaging with them and returning their phone calls;\r\n\r\n- who serves the best interests of the community not for self interest or political agenda; and \r\n\r\n- who works effectively with others -- both community members and civic administration -- to find creative solutions and achieve positive outcomes for the Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge ward.  \r\n\r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nWhat experience do you bring to compliment your role as city councillor?\r\n\r\nI have lived in Charleswood my entire life and have spent the last 13 years working with local businesses, community centres, youth and families in the Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge ward. \r\n\r\nMy hands-on experience includes:\r\n \r\n- Working to reduce and prevent neighborhood crime as a drop-in coordinator at Westdale and River West Park schools\r\n \r\n- Providing effective and affordable community services for young families as a volunteer coach and program coordinator for community hockey teams (such as the Charleswood Hawks, Roblin Park Raiders, Oak Park Raiders and Varsity View Falcons)\r\n \r\n- Establishing positive working relationships with local businesses, provincial government representatives, parents and community organizations as an educational assistant with the Pembina Trails School Division and fundraiser for local community groups\r\n \r\nI am currently employed as a Juvenile Counsellor with Manitoba Justice and serve as a Board Member for the Charleswood Hawks Hockey Club. \r\n\r\nMy connections to this community are based on real relationships forged through hard work and results.  My experience shows that I can work effectively with others and achieve positive outcomes with limited resources. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nAccountability - councillors returning phone calls and emails personally to constituents and communicating with residents on issues that affect them.  Our leaders are elected to serve the people and not self interests or political agenda. I care about this great community. I will be a councillor who is in touch with the community and goes to work every day with the community's best interest at heart. \r\n\r\nStopping wasteful spending - I will work to find creative solutions to our fiscal crisis by making tough decisions on priorities in this city and finding creative solutions. The old model of doing things is not working.\r\n\r\nMaking responsible development decisions - New developments can be the catalyst to invoke positive progress within our community. If planned and developed properly, they can help upgrade our streets and sewers while improving upon our current traffic flow and road safety concerns. \r\n\r\nThese decisions need to be made responsibly because they will change the landscape of our community. Development needs to reflect the qualities that make our community great, including: parks, green spaces and safe and quiet streets. They need to be done right and made for the right reasons, not for private or political benefit.\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nThe people.  I have had the opportunity to meet and work with so many different community organizations and individuals both in my previous experience and as part of this campaign.  I am consistently inspired by the level and calibre of commitment they bring to their neighbourhoods, neighbours, children, and the issues that affect them.  Like me, people are invested in this ward.  They engage with their neighbours through community club events and fundraisers, set an example for active living by taking advantage of our green infrastructure like the Assiniboine Forest and Fort Whyte Alive trail, respect their neighbourhoods by taking pride in their property, and engage with local government by taking the time to make their voices heard.   People want the best for their families and this community because this is where they live and this is where they are going to stay.  They expect and deserve a councillor that understands that and feels the same way.  I am excited and humbled by the opportunity to represent the people in Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge.  \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nThis city needs vision and it needs someone who can not only lead that vision but represent those that it affects.  Politics loom large in elections, but representing you isn't about politics.  This community deserves more than that.  It deserves a leader who understands the issues in our community, who draws on our community organizations for information and insight, and who has a proven track record of being able to work with people to achieve real results.  I believe I am that leader and I am asking for your support on October 22 so that we can improve this ward and move this city forward together.  \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":217,"electoral_race_id":44,"created_at":"2014-08-01T01:43:54.665-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-10T12:53:11.362-05:00"},{"id":296,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\n I want to continue to make a positive impact on the education offered in Pembina Trails.  I have represented Ward 3 of Pembina Trails School Division for the past 16 years.  When I ran initially, I was the parent to an elementary and a high school student and was deeply interested in the decisions made by the Division and how they had an effect on the education of my children.  I have continued to be passionate about providing the best possible education for children in Pembina Trails.  My children have now graduated from Pembina Trails Schools, and have gone on to further education.  My son is a graduate of the University of Manitoba in computer science and law, and my daughter is currently attending university in the US.  Prior to University she completed her apprenticeship and worked as a hairstylist.  As a parent of children who have been all the way through Pembina Trails Schools, in both the French Immersion and English program, and are successfully commencing their careers, my knowledge of their challenges, successes and experiences provides essential background into the decisions I make as a Trustee.   \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI am the Executive Director of a regulated health profession in Manitoba.  My career began in law, where I was a paralegal for many years, working both in law firms and for private industry.  I have been a Trustee for 16 years; Chair (2005-2007) of the Board of Trustees and Vice-Chair (2003-2005) of the Board of Trustees.  I have served on all of the Committees of the Board, and have chaired the Finance Committee (2000-2003), and Communications Committee (2012-2014).  I was a member of the Governing Board of Winnipeg Technical College (now Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology) from 2006-2010, and Chair of that Governing Board from 2008-2010.  I believe that School Boards benefit from a variety of perspectives, which is best achieved by having Trustees that range from parents at home with young children through to experienced executives with a variety of business experience.  \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nAs a Trustee, I've always asked about the data we have to determine whether our children are engaged in their education and achieving their goals.  This is an important way to ensure that our work bears fruit for our Division and our children.  I have supported our three divisional goals:  that all children be engaged in their education, that by Grade 8 all students should be achieving at grade level, and that all children graduate.  These goals form an important foundation in how all Pembina Trails School Division employees work with the children in their care.  I hope to continue to work on these and other issues that are important for our future.  \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI've lived in the Pembina Trails School Division for most of my life.  My husband and I, and our siblings, are all graduates of the Pembina Trails School Division.  My children are graduates of Vincent Massey and Fort Richmond Collegiates.  I believe that the education offered to students in Pembina Trails is excellent and that the people who work with and for the Division are ethical, caring and committed educators.  I hope to be able to help ensure this will continue.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI hope to have the opportunity to continue to represent the voters of Pembina Trails School Division Ward 3 for another four years.  \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":24,"electoral_race_id":59,"created_at":"2014-09-13T02:30:33.185-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-19T15:40:41.874-05:00"},{"id":233,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nThere has become a total disconnect between the citizens, the elected leaders of the City, and the senior bureaucrats who manage the day-to-day administration of the City affairs. Many of the senior bureaucrats appear to think that the citizens are an unpleasant nuisance to the efficient management of their Departments and the elected leaders are in too cozy a relationship with the bureaucrats to have the will to \"crack the whip\" that they collectively hold in their hands, in defence of the citizens. The water main problems (on I believe it was Laxdale Blvd.) where there were at least 10 breaks in 8 weeks last winter and the residents were told that replacement of the mains was scheduled only for the summer of 2015 and that nothing could be done before that date is one example - and then Charles Adler got involved and the scheduling was moved up to 2014. Another example of the senior bureaucracy run amok  is where a citizen in my ward ran afoul of a junior bureaucrat in the Neighbourhood Liveability Dept. over his determination that certain items on the citizen's property were \"garbage\" and had to be immediately removed.\r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nThe citizen appealed the bureaucrat's Order to the appropriate Council sub-committee (after paying a $250 appeal fee) but was unable to appear on the appeal date because he was ill. The citizen notified the City Clerk of the illness before the scheduled meeting requesting an adjournment, however, the agents for the head of the Dept.,Clive Wightman, forced the Chairman, Scott Fielding, to hold the hearing in the absence of the citizen and a decision against the citizen was registered. In due course the City bureaucracy attended at the citizen's property , removed what they considered \"garbage\" in a 1 hour operation and added a total of $840.00 to the citizen's property tax bill to \"cover the cost\" of the 1 hour \"garbage\" removal. These stories are legion. They are happening all over the City. Is it any wonder that every young family that is able to move to one of the many \"bedroom communities\" surrounding Winnipeg has done so, is in the process of doing so or is waiting for the outcome of this election before they decide to do so? I am a retired financial professional ( accountant) and I can clearly see where Winnipeg is headed.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nAnd it is not a pretty place. Everyone had better get ready  for at least a 25% property tax increase over the next 4 years, because the \"day of reckoning\" is right around the corner. I am not standing for issues so much as trying to warn my fellow citizens about issues that are not being discussed during this election. I am a finance guy, not a trained nurse or musician (God bless them both). I have seen many businesses fail because of poor management, inattention to customer needs, employee hostility/vindictiveness and I see it again in the City of Winnipeg. The City of Winnipeg is on the verge of a very nasty war with its \"bedroom communities\" over the \"poaching\" by those communities of its long term tax base ie: financially stable young families in search of safe, clean and friendly communities where they can put down roots and raise their children - with much lower property taxes than are assessed in Winnipeg for the same type of property. The buzz word is \"transparency\". I am a finance guy and I don't have a clue as to the long term state of the City's finances. Do you?\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nFor instance, what is the \"unfunded pension liability\" that the City is going to have to pay out to its retired employees over the next 20 years and how is this debt going to be retired while at the same time that major infrastructure (another buzz word) renewal ABSOLUTELY HAS TO BE DONE. This Ward has to be one of the most unique on the continent. It runs from Waterfront Drive in The Forks  to North/South Drive in Fort Garry, to the \"Gates\" of Armstrong Point, Maryland St. to Portage Ave. to the Red River and down to the St. Vital bridge, along Churchill Drive to Jubilee Ave. to Pembina Hwy. The Ward includes both #1 Wellington Crescent and considerably lesser residences on Langside St. It has Osborne Village (one of the best residential areas in Canada), night people, day people, straight people, gay people, black people, white people, asian people, aboriginal and metis people, former Russian, American, Chinese, European, Indian, Pakistani, German and Jewish people, very rich people and \"bag ladies\" all living together in (relative) peace. A true touch stone for the Museum Of Human Rights.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am a father, a retired accountant, a former Official Agent for a Federal Green Party candidate, a former member of the Federal Green Party, someone who grew up in a nice, loving, middle class family with the associated toys. I have been a long term resident of \"The Village\" and it has softened many of my rough and radical edges. But when the accountants start getting angry WATCH OUT.\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":223,"electoral_race_id":46,"created_at":"2014-08-25T15:39:04.154-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-17T21:14:52.424-05:00"},{"id":255,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nIn 2006 and 2010 I made a commitment to ensure Pembina Trails School Division offered a safe, vibrant and challenging learning environment for students.  Today, Pembina Trail’s students are performing well above the Provincial average and for the most part above the Canadian average.  I am committed to maintaining this proven track record and I want to ensure our school division continues to meet the needs of our students and our community. \r\n\r\nOver the last eight years, there has been significant growth in school-based daycares, safety programs for students and staff, and significant major capital improvements to aging facilities, yet we have maintained the lowest mill rate (lower taxes) in the City or Winnipeg. While the overall Province appears to be lagging in student achievement that is not the situation in Pembina Trails.  Staff and students have made our school division a leader in educational programming and academic achievement. Through sound fiscal management, staff in Pembina Trails have the resources in technology and the support staff to assist in the classroom, and continue to deliver quality education so our students are actively engaged in learning.  \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nAs a current Trustee, I work with our communities to ensure that our schools offer the educational programming and services that meet community expectations for student achievement.  \r\n\r\nWith four young children attending Oakenwald, General Byng, and Vincent Massey Collegiate in the Pembina Trails School Division, I have the opportunity to see the results and meet with parents, teachers, and administrators on an ongoing basis and can see the issues from all sides.\r\n\r\nAs an active supporter of our community and experienced School Trustee, I stay connected and have served our community in a range of ways, including:\r\nVice Chair, Board of Trustees (2012 – 2014); Governing Board Member - Winnipeg Technical College; Chair, Finance Committee; Chair, Buildings, Property and Transportation; President’s Award for Outstanding Leadership (2005); Outstanding Citizen’s Award for Leadership in the Community - Winnipeg (2003); Board Member, Fort Garry Ringette Association; and, President Fort Garry Community Centre (2000 - 2002)\r\n\r\nAs a graduate of the University of Manitoba, Faculty of Management (Honours), and an employee with Manitoba Hydro for over 25 years, I have a strong background in financial and human resource management that complements my role as a School Trustee.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nOngoing monitoring of student assessment data ensures funding is allocated to areas where it is needed to improve student outcomes.  Trustees must remain vigilant on efforts made to improve student-learning outcomes.  Currently, Trustees in Pembina Trials receive reports from senior administration on student learning assessment results and this practice must continue.   \r\n\r\nTaxation is always an important issue and I will continue to ensure programming is meeting expected outcomes while continuing to maintain the lowest mill rate in Winnipeg.  The division is moving into negotiations in the next year, and this will impact the cost of education.  We need to set competitive salaries and be aware of the impact these salaries will have on the cost of education in the Province.\r\n\r\nWhile our school division has made significant strides towards reducing the number of incidents of bullying in our schools, I believe we can do more.  Maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, and respecting diversity and individual ability, are paramount for a student’s sense of belonging and self worth. We must continue to support initiatives to increase student awareness of the negative impact of hazing and bullying activities.   \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nWhile it is hard to narrow down to one thing all the great things that are currently underway in our division, I would have to say that what I appreciate most is that parents and the community at large are so supportive of what is happening in our school division.  Teaching staff are always commenting on how wonderful it is to work in a division where their work is appreciated by parents, the Board, and the broader community.  It is truly exciting to be a part of the growth in our division, and the energy in our schools is amazing; I see it each time I walk into one of our schools to meet with staff.  The energy and enthusiasm, the look of engagement on each of the students’ faces, is inspiring and one of the greatest rewards of being a School Trustee.  \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nOn October 22, 2014, let’s continue working together to build a strong future for our students and our community. It has been an honour to serve the residents of Pembina Trails School Division for the past eight years. I will continue to work hard with creativity and understanding to ensure Pembina Trails School Division continues to meet the needs of our students and our community.\r\n\r\nI am dedicated to supporting education that provides students with the learning experiences and knowledge they need to develop their potential while in school, in order to assume their role as productive citizens entering the post-secondary world of education and the workforce.\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":18,"electoral_race_id":58,"created_at":"2014-09-12T00:08:35.352-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-19T07:41:39.947-05:00"},{"id":228,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nAs a proud father of two children, Aspyn and Julien, born here in Winnipeg, I have a vested interest to see their future more sustainable and with less financial debt and this has motivated me for years to advocate strongly for a number of positive changes to our beautiful city.   As a multicultural community, I believe that our best strengths lie in working together and engaging meaningful dialogue with our neighbours.  Together we can build a vibrant City that has a sustainable approach to transportation, housing, child care, senior care and the youth.\r\n\r\nI have been blessed to have had a grandfather, George Barrett, that spent the time to impress upon my heart the importance of taking care of, giving back and learning from our seniors during my youth.  St. Charles Ward, in my view, has one of the highest number of seniors in Winnipeg.  My way of serving would be to give back to the seniors in our community the care and attention they all deserve.  To serve them as their councillor would be my greatest honour and would certainly make my grandfather and grandmother proud.  This is why I am running in the St. Charles Ward.\r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nMany years successfully lobbying the Council on many issues gives me the greatest experience needed to lobby for future issues on behalf St. Charles Ward residents:\r\no\tThe name change “Garbage Day” to “Recycle Day” – it was a hard battle with Council, media and the public for 8 months, but we got it done.  It was an important First Step to beginning Recycling.\r\no\tReducing the number of plastic bags to the landfill.\r\no\tPromoting Reusable bags throughout all the major malls \u0026 grocery stores.\r\no\tThe larger Blue Recycling bin now found in our homes today.\r\no\tChallenging the PPMA (Professional Property Management Association) to institute an Apartment Recycling Program.\r\no\tExpanding the video surveillance systems in higher crime areas.\r\n\r\nAs a small business owner and a City of Winnipeg Transit Bus Operator, I have heard and seen many issues play-out right in front of me.  Over the years I have developed the Art of Listening to my passengers and customers which is a great asset.  \r\n\r\nMy dedication and commitment to ‘staying the course’, following-through and standing tall when others won’t or can’t stand makes me a more suitable candidate to advocate for St. Charles Ward residents.\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\no\tThe Environment – making sure that we eventually ban plastic bags and implement curbside ‘compost’ pickup.\r\no\tThe Seniors – investing in affordable housing and proper monitoring of care facilities.\r\no\tRoad Construction – working with all concerned to bring out a more cost-efficient and less intrusive way of fixing our roads.  One priority is the crews work from 8:00 p.m. till 7:00 a.m. on Regional Roads not residential.\r\no\tThe Youth and childcare – My belief I have had for many years is that prevention is better than cure.  The most knowledge absorbed in our children’s lives is during 0-6 years and we need to offer the best care to them at this age.  The number One way to keep youth out of trouble is to keep them engaged in sports.\r\n\r\nI believe all of these issues start and come together at the City level.  Together we can work to make our City greener, safer and more sustainable for our childrens’ children.\r\n \r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nDuring my campaign, I have had the pleasure of meeting many well-informed elderly residents who are still politically engaged who have opened their hearts and minds with a wealth of advice which I will keep in my heart forever.  In St. Charles, Crestview and Westwood many of my Meet \u0026 Greets in all the blocks were very positive and welcoming.  I Thank You All for this!!  Hope to meet most of the residents before October 22nd.  Responding to a need of the seniors, I have begun a Petition to extend the Pedestrian light that crosses Portage North and South between Sturgeon and Cavalier.  As it stands today, the crossing light signals are too short and do not allow seniors enough time to cross 8 lanes of traffic.  I am confident with these changes, as small as it may be, will add a significant benefit and safety to the seniors.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nMy strongest attribute is to have Vision - to lobby Council and be successful in bringing about meaningful change.  My passion and vision will bring new and exciting opportunities for the St. Charles Ward.  Some candidates have never been to City Hall to lobby for anything, or even to sit through a full day of a Council meeting to see how it works.  One prerequisite should be that “some experience at City Hall-making presentations, working with other councilors or even just advocating for an issue”\r\n\r\nASK ALL CANDIDATES:\r\n“If you are so passionate about an issue on your information piece what have you done about it in the last 5 to 10 years?” OR\r\n“What ideas have you presented to Council that will improve the lives of your community, the seniors, the youth and the children?”\r\n\r\n                                                                                         TALK IS CHEAP.  ACTION IS EVERYTHING!!\r\n\r\nI am the only candidate to advocate a ‘New Way of Doing Business’.  This will come about by having weekly meetings in the community on issues that are to be voted on and for the residents to have their say.  \r\nIf I am blessed with your vote I am committed to you.\r\nPlease vote for Don Woodstock\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":220,"electoral_race_id":52,"created_at":"2014-08-14T01:00:33.482-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-08T19:17:22.182-05:00"},{"id":354,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI work for Opportunities for Employment as an Employer Liaison.

I am very impressed by the feeling of ownership that the school community has for its school division.Throughout my campaign l was often challenged on questions asking me \" What abilities and values will l bring to the LRSD. I am very impressed by the number of candidates within ward 3 and the passion that we all share to want to assist the LRSD in continuing to grow, to address the needs of their student body and to maintain a strong and positive working environment between the division, the board and the school community.\r\n\r\nI am very impressed at the way the LRSD values diversity, in its student body's cultural and ethnic backgrounds, in its curriculum variety and in creating a positive learning environment in a very social economic diverse student population . Teachers in the division have told me they view diversity in its many forms, as an opportunity to enrich and engage students in the learning process, to connect with the school community and to embrace the value that diversity brings to all parties involved in the LRSD.  \r\n\r\nLRSD is a welcoming, caring learning environment\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI believe that as a result of my work and volunteer experience along with my diversified education, l have the skill set that would allow me to bring value to the LRSD as a School Trustee.

I decided early on, in 2014, that I wanted to run.  Like many concerned citizens in Winnipeg, I was bothered by the lack of transparency, and accountability at City Hall, and especially our ward of Transcona.  Which amplified this concern was the fact that our current councillor has sat on the EPC, been the deputy mayor and chairman of the city's finance committee and would have been aware of many of the negative stories that have run in the media.  \r\n\r\nI have heard many residents complain of being tired of Transcona being treated like a secondary project by our councillor.  There have been many complaints by residents of Transcona of a lack of communication with our councillor, failure to call back/email, and attend events.  \r\n\r\nMy priorities are:\r\n\r\nFixing our Aging Infrastructure\r\nSupporting our Local Economy \u0026 Jobs\r\nEffectively Planning and Improving Transit in our Growing Community\r\nPlanning Projects On-Time and On Budget\r\nIncreasing Accountability and Transparency at City Hall\r\nBeing a Part of Our Community by being Engaged and Accessible\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nI have served in the community for 25 years as President of the South Transcona Community Club, the Community Clubs Board, Native Women's Transition Centre, Rotary Club and coaching all levels of hockey.  I have sat as the Chairman of the Hi Neighbour Festival in Transcona for the past 2 years.\r\n\r\nI am the Vice-President of Business Development with Legacy Bowes Group, and have managed budgets, projects, and human resources at every level.  I have run several successful businesses, including Superior Hockey Clinic which assisted in developing the skills of thousands of hockey students, helping them achieve their goals.  I was also the co-founder and co-owner of the former Team Canada Mixed Martial Arts now known as the Canadian Fighting Centre.  I know what teamwork means, having served as the Regional Scout for the Calgary Hitmen of the WHL, and know how to identify leaders in the community and foster their growth and development.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nAging Infrastructure - While Transcona will come to appreciate the new amenities we are receiving (once they are built), it does not serve the community well to have new amenities without having the infrastructure to support them.  Transcona roads are in horrible condition.  We need to get back to basics, and prioritize our road repairs.  \r\n\r\nHaving said this, I feel that many of the projects that have been completed in Winnipeg have left Winnipeg with a black eye.  Our project management/transparency/accountability needs to be improved.  We need the right people for the right jobs.  The Plessis Underpass is the biggest example of a mismanaged project in Transcona, and has left our area gridlocked during rush hour.\r\n\r\nI would like to see a whistle blowing policy created and implemented.  Also, increased details on expenditures for ward allowances.\r\n\r\nBeing a Part of Our Community by being Engaged and Accessible - I would return the East Kildonan-Transcona Community Committee back to the community.  These meetings should be held as a town-hall style meeting as then residents could attend and be informed.  I will also return phone calls and email to all, not just a select group.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nI appreciate the sense of community Transcona has.  Many of the residents are 2nd, 3rd and even 4th generation Transcona residents.  We are a tight knit community, and fiercely proud of our ward.  Transcona has many volunteers who do wonderful work.  This is why I am so passionate about representing Transcona, as I feel that for the past 4 years, we have been slipping away from what we represent.  Transcona has become more about development, and expansion, and less about community.  I would like to see us return to our roots.  \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI feel that I present as the best candidate for the position.  My experience in the community, volunteerism, education is what Transcona needs.  I would be a councillor for all the people, not just select groups.  I have spent countless hours talking to everyone.  One of the largest groups of people that have been especially outspoken are the seniors, who have indicated they are tired of the status quo, and would like to see Transcona under new leadership.  I have dedicated myself to the improvement of Transcona, and have been talking to the residents of Transcona to see what they truly want and need.  Transcona wants to be informed.  They want a councillor that will be visible in the community, and are tired of feeling like a secondary project, or being mislead and not informed.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":208,"electoral_race_id":55,"created_at":"2014-07-07T23:53:11.344-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-09T13:48:42.491-05:00"},{"id":247,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI am seeking re-election to the Pembina Trails School Board. I have always been a strong advocate for the public education system and wish to continue working for the students and families in Charleswood as their representative on the Board. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nMy background in education has complimented my role as a School Trustee. I have taught in the North, in a rural community and in Winnipeg in both English Instruction and French Immersion. I have extensive experience from teaching in the Early Years to being a Resource Teacher working with students of all ages, collaborating with parents and being on inter-disciplinary teams. I have served on two provincial advisory committees: childcare and curriculum. As well, I was President of the teachers' association. My experience and knowledge as a Board member  coupled with my background gives me a wide perspective on issues. I have been in a position of leadership having served as Chair of the PTSD Board to being Chair of the Winnipeg Public Library Board. I also have shown my commitment to my community through volunteering for the Winnipeg Blue Bomber Flight Crew, the Charleswood Horticultural Club, Gardens Manitoba and Run for the Cure. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nThe Board has developed three expectations for student learning - literacy/numeracy proficiency, engagement of students in learning and graduation from high school. These have been shared with the community and our staff/schools have been working to achieve these goals. It is a belief that all kids can learn. As Chair of the Human Resource and Policy Committee I was active in the revisions to the Pembina Trails Standard of Behaviour document \"Creating a Safe, Caring and Inclusive Learning Community\". There are financial pressures on the Division from building new schools to providing professional development for teachers and from facility repairs to providing supports for children who are having difficulty. Budget development is crucial as Trustees do have to balance the needs of the system with a respect for the tax payer. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nPembina Trails has a wonderful reputation not only within the province but also throughout the country. As a recent speaker said \"it is the rock star\" of divisions. The teachers, principals, support staff and senior administration always have the best interests of the students in mind. They are a group of very dedicated individuals who work very hard to improve the learning of all students. I represent Ward 1 that is a community of people that have pride in their schools, value education and are involved in the school system. I am very thankful to be a part of this learning community.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nAs a long time resident of Charleswood I feel that the community knows that I have represented them, their interests and concerns to the best of my ability. I have attended numerous school events from assemblies to BBQ's as well as bringing greetings at graduation ceremonies to attending pancake breakfasts.

I firmly believe that education is the relentless pursuit of excellence and “not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.”  W.B. Yeats\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nMy experience includes my previous 15 years as a Trustee, as well as 3 terms as Chairman of the Board.   I also hold a Certificate in Public Sector Management from the University of Manitoba, in addition to my studies at the Faculty of Architecture.   As a previous small retail business owner for 18 years and a retired provincial civil servant, Administration \u0026 Finance, also 18 years, I am familiar with the workings of large organizations.   I have also sat on numerous City, Provincial and University Boards with mandates of policy, governance and budgetary concerns.   \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI feel that it is long past time for a serious discussion on the future of education in this province.   I mean a frank open discussion at the highest levels, with the actual stakeholders, with the purpose of creating a plan and a direction for next five years.   Not some blather or bafflegab about “the future” but a concrete set of proposals and at the end, and most importantly, an evaluation on whether we achieved them.   \r\nEvery aspect should be on the agenda: funding, taxation, structure, staffing, governance, assessment, achievement, politics and more.   Frankly, I’m tired of the earnest cliché “children are our future” without someone actually putting forward a plan to ensure that they, and us, have a future.\r\nI believe we need a concentrated effort to improve our graduation rates.     Why after 12 years in the system are students failing to understand what they have been taught?\r\nI believe we must examine our Pass/Fail policies to ensure that students have the knowledge and confidence to advance to the next grade.   We do them no favour by passing them simply because it’s time.  \r\nI believe we need a unified effort to root out drugs and pushers in our schools.\r\n\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThe diversity and composition of the ward, it’s almost a microcosm of the city itself.   Within this mosaic of culture, language, religion, socio-economic factors and diverse opinions, I am gratified by the willingness of many people to work and share together.   Big hearts willing to take on big jobs.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am an independent candidate and will not bring a personal agenda to board business.   I am not indebted to private organizations seeking favours, or special interest groups within the education system.   I do not represent a political party, nor have I accepted donations, assistance, information, labour or influence from a political party.   I do not pretend to be an independent.   I am an independent, and accountable to the electorate as a whole. \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":41,"electoral_race_id":80,"created_at":"2014-09-12T01:06:05.777-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-09T11:50:38.100-05:00"},{"id":216,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nThe 2014 civic election in Winnipeg promises to be a watershed in this city’s history in which we turn the corner on an era that has been characterized by willful neglect and visionless leadership. We have an unprecedented opportunity to return a progressive and collaborative majority to City Council — one that can offer real leadership and purpose in making Winnipeg the most livable city in Canada. I want to be a part of that new majority.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nAs an ordained minister, I have earned the respect of people across the continent as a trustworthy and progressive leader. In my work, both in business and the church, I have developed an expertise on governance, organizational development, conflict management, and leadership training. My roots in St. James are deep and I care passionately about our city, but especially the St. James, Brooklands and Weston neighbourhoods.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n1. Restoring trust in city hall o ensure business is conducted ethically and above suspicion, while establishing clear guidelines for reporting to council on all city projects.\r\n\r\n2. Rebuilding our city's infrastructure by developing a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate streets, sidewalks, sewers and water lines.\r\n\r\n3. Supporting our public assets by investing in our parks, libraries, community centres and green spaces, while ensuring that our public assets are not sacrificed for short term gain and that citizens are getting value for their tax dollars.\r\n\r\n4. Growing the vitality of our community by (a) working with partners to establish a farmers’ market in St. James, (b) expanding the development of splash pads and spray parks accessible to all parts of our community, (c) working with community members to identify areas for off-leash dog parks and green spaces, and (d) ensuring that Brooklands and Weston are integral parts of the life of the ward.\r\n\r\n5. Making environmental health and sustainability an integral part of the planning process by requiring new developments to be environmentally sustainable. Having a safe and efficient public transportation system that serves the city as it grows—making active transportation and pedestrian safety priorities in the planning process.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nAs a lifelong resident of St. James, whose family first settled near Brooklands in 1910, it is virtually impossible to name just one thing that I appreciate about St. James, Brooklands and Weston. So I'll note its rich history as a community. I grew up listening to stories of the early families in the area — the Bourkes and the Hallets, the Prudens and the McKays, the Bannatynes and the Bruces, the Isbisters and the Taits — and I met several of their descendants.  Our community has been home to several talented artists — Beryl Joyce and Clarence Tillenius and R.G. Pollock — and  they were preceded by L.L. Fitzgerald (of the Group of Seven) and Valentine Fanshaw. Seven generations of my family have lived in St. James — so far.  This community is etched deep in my bones and I carry it with me wherever I go.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nThe sign on the road as you enter Winnipeg, which reads \"One Great City,\" is not just a slogan — it's a fact! Together we can build an even greater city that is not simply a wonderful place to live, but a progressive city that is the envy of people near and far.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":213,"electoral_race_id":53,"created_at":"2014-07-12T02:51:46.646-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-02T13:24:35.537-05:00"},{"id":283,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI chose to put my name forward as a candidate for School Trustee as a direct result of my lifelong commitment to education and to my community. As a parent and educator, I am passionate about maintaining an effective public school system that meets the needs of all students. I hope to continue to serve St. James-Assiniboia, and maintain my focus as a dedicated, responsive Trustee, working on behalf of students, families, and the community.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nProfessionally, I have been a teacher, consultant, vice principal, and principal, with experience working in urban Winnipeg, as well as rural and northern Manitoba. Most of my career in education was spent in Winnipeg’s inner-city schools. \r\n\r\nCurrently, I hold three professional positions. I teach in the University of Manitoba's Faculty of Education, training aspiring teachers. I am also a professional writer, with an extensive collection of educational books, entitled The Hands On Series, published and implemented in schools across Canada. My publisher, Portage and Main Press, is a local company that specializes in Canadian content and professional books for teachers. \r\n\r\nI am also a current School Trustee in the St. James-Assiniboia School Division, having completed my first four-year term in this role.

I have also served on a variety of School Board Committees, including Marketing, Early Childhood, Awards and Scholarships, Board-Teacher Liaison, and the St. James Scholarship Foundation.\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n1. Support all students in meeting their potential through effective educational programs, including academics, the arts, athletics, trades programs, and special education. I believe that our public school system must provide a balance of programs in order to meet the needs of all students.\r\n2. Seek ways to serve an increasingly diverse community population. The community of St. James-Assiniboia is changing in terms of demographics. \r\n3. Enhance connections between schools and the community by supporting family centres, child care, recreation programs, and community organizations. I see the public school system as a community-based institution and, as such, we must work together with other organizations to cooperatively serve our citizens.\r\n4. Keep the needs of students and the community first.\r\n5. Maintain fair and equitable school taxes. As a School Trustee, we have been put in a position of trust. That means that the public has put their faith in us in terms of being fiscally responsible.\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nOver the past four years as a School Trustee in the St. James-Assiniboia School Division, I have come to appreciate the positive culture that exists at all levels of the organization. Furthermore, as I have been active in this campaign, the citizens of this community have conveyed their very positive impressions of this school system, and they would like to see this same level of effectiveness and accountability maintained in the future.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI hope to continue to serve my community, and to ensure that our children are provided with a quality education, in a safe and secure school environment.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":51,"electoral_race_id":60,"created_at":"2014-09-13T01:25:21.694-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-01T16:19:42.909-05:00"},{"id":302,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nThere has been much accomplished but much that needs to be done.Craig - \r\n\r\n-  Stands for ratepayers to ensure that taxes remain fair and that St. James Assiniboia remains one of those regions that are affordable through one of the lowest mill rates.

There needs to be legislation to allow for better enforcement. \r\n- Roads and access and parking in schools need to receive infrastructure support while promoting healthy living options\r\n- We must keep ensuring quality education while still maintaining reasonable taxes on our ratepayer. The Province must be lobbied to increase operating support to education equally to all school divisions and not assume that some areas should tax their residents more. They announce 2% for the metro school divisions but distribute it unequally giving St. James Assiniboia students nearly 0% in operating grants for the last three years. With a large amount of our division composed of seniors and those on fixed income, this is an unfair burden. \r\n- Continue to promote safer schools and reduce bullying through supporting programs like Roots of Empathy\r\n- Ensure that citizenship focuses on children, families and our community first\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nWe have a wonderful ward with great families, terrific homeowners who work hard to make St. James a beautiful place to live.

We need to work with all partners in our community - business, community leaders  early childcare providers to ensure that we partner and grow together. We have a proud heritage and a terrific hope for the future. Our seniors provide wisdom, experience and stability while our new families enrich and provide diversity and opportunity. We need to know our past and work hard today in order to produce the positive results for the future.  \r\nOur school division is the largest single employer in St. James Assiniboia and we have a duty to be fair employers, good stewards of the community and a positive contributor to residents.

Neighbourhood schools should welcome all children and ensure accessibility to the buildings and programs.

I want to continue to contribute to the direction of this and other initiatives on behalf of the communities I serve and the entire Division.  \r\n\r\nOther issues or initiatives that are important to me include:\r\n\r\n - Ensuring that teachers have the resources that they need to provide our children with the highest quality education;\r\n\r\n - Continuing to support and promote the value of public education;\r\n\r\n - Providing responsible fiscal management to ensure that our tax dollars are being spent effectively;\r\n\r\n - Lobbying the provincial government to ensure that local school boards are being adequately funded; and\r\n\r\n - Ensuring that our schools are welcoming and that our children learn and play in a healthy and secure environment.\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nWe have a great school division with great schools.  Our children have incredible opportunities and they are excelling.  They are, in fact, exceeding both provincial as well as national test scores in all academic areas.  One area for improvement is that we need to do more to promote our successes and good news stories. \r\n\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nIt has been an honour to serve on the Pembina Trails School Board. If re-elected, I hope to be able to serve to the best of my ability for another four years.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":20,"electoral_race_id":58,"created_at":"2014-09-12T00:06:52.491-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-17T16:58:15.967-05:00"},{"id":303,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI care,\r\nI want to make a difference.\r\nI have always had a strong belief in the value of education and its role in shaping our future. Our children are the leaders of tomorrow\r\nI am committed to student success and maintaining standards of excellence in education to ensure each child achieves to the best of their ability.\r\nI care deeply about our schools and children and I am confident in my believe that I can make a difference.\r\nI also would like to continue the work the Division is doing with its commitment to equity.\r\nExcellence and equity for all children.  .\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nProudly represented my community as a Trustee for eight years.\r\n-  I have been a long time resident of Seven Oaks School Division, Garden City eleven years and West Kildonan  fifteen years. \r\n-  B.Sc. Chemistry and Molecular Biology.\r\n-  As a Trustee I have been active in the Division as: Chair of Negotiations Board/ Teaching Assistants, Chair of Policy Committee, member of Educational Leave Committee,\r\n   member of Accident Review Committee, member of Board Staff Committee, member of Board Student Liaison Committee.\r\n-  Through Manitoba School Boars Association{MSBA}: member of The Manitoba Addictions Awareness Committee and member of MUST Fund Committee.\r\n-  Participated in professional development: conferences and seminars facilitated by MSBA, CSBA, NSBA and AERA.\r\n-  Program on Negotiations at Harvard Law School.\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n-  I will always stand for our children: - That education is an amazing experience for each and every child. - That each and every child has a success story. -That each and every child being educated to lead \"fulfilling lives within the world as moral people and contributing members of society.\"\r\n-  For our children to thrive they must be given all the necessary tools and supports: - We must ensure that our schools and classrooms have best possible learning conditions -- are safe and caring for all .-  We must ensure that our schools are ready and able to meet the needs of all our learners - each and every child achieves to the best of their ability - We must ensure that our Public Education System is the best it can be - For we are educating our Nation and shaping our future.\r\n-  I feel the ultimate reward is seeing our students walk across the stage to receive their diplomas and knowing we have done our best to prepare them for their next stage of life whether it be college, university or workforce.     \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\n-  Knowing that some children are disadvantaged means accepting the responsibility to help them overcome the obstacles they face - poverty, disability, racism.\r\n-  In Seven Oaks our Board has worked hard to remove barriers to participation and help parents make end meet by eliminating fees associated with the education, no cost for field trips and school activities, free or low cost after hour and summer programs, low cost school supplies, free lunch supervision, learn to swim and learn to skate programs.\r\n Middle Years students are provided with band instruments free of charge.\r\n-  We provide rich educational opportunities to students who would otherwise go without them.\r\n-  We do it all \"one kid at a time\" and we do it all to make a difference.    \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI very much enjoy being a Trustee. I feel a sense of satisfaction and enjoyment because I know that I am helping students parents and my community.\r\n-  As your Trustee I worked hard and advocated for:\r\n-  Equity in funding. - Fair and equal taxation for our community. - safe, caring, respectful and inclusive school communities. - Equity in education, meeting the needs of all our learners. - \"Making poverty a history\"- child poverty initiatives in Seven Oaks School Division. - Establishment of Student Support Services in our High Schools. - Eliminating school fees associated with the education. -  Fee reduction for My Camp and other summer programs. - Fee reduction for the Summer School. - Expansion of summer programs {BEEP} throughout the Division. - Breakfast Program in all schools.\r\nI respectfully ask my community for continued support.       \r\n    \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":71,"electoral_race_id":64,"created_at":"2014-09-14T02:22:43.364-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-05T17:54:39.183-05:00"},{"id":301,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI want to continue my work as a School Trustee, to make a difference in the lives of children by ensuring that they are educated to their fullest potential, always keeping in mind the ability of our taxpayers to pay for that education.  It is truly a balancing act; you can’t have one without the other.  I believe in supporting initiatives in the Early Years to help build a strong educational foundation through programs such as Reading Recovery, and Early Numeracy; and, at the Middle and Senior Years by focussing on student achievement through relevant programming and assessment.  I want to continue to provide a safe and healthy environment in which all of our children can learn.  It has been, and will continue to be my goal to help parents deal with their concerns by being a full time Trustee, devoting all my energies to my Trusteeship, being accessible, and approachable to parents.  I want to continue to work with staff to ensure that the necessary resources and supports are in place to support our children.  I want to continue to be a strong voice for my community of Transcona at the board table.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI bring 22 years of experience as the incumbent school trustee.  My track record demonstrates strong leadership, proven ability, effectiveness, and the dedication of making school trustee my full time job.  I have both negotiations and financial background and experience.  I have been Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Board; I have sat as the Chairman or member of many school board committees.  I have sat on committees at the provincial level for education.  I bring both leadership skills and I work collaboratively with others.  I bring excellent communication skills, common sense and a genuine caring for children, staff and my community of Transcona.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nThe first issue is the inequity in educational funding that exists within the province.  This needs to be addressed so that equity and fairness are achieved both by the school divisions who receive the funding and by the tax payers who are paying for it.  We need to lobby the government to create a new process for collecting school taxes and distributing them fairly and equitably across the province.\r\n\r\nSecondly, would be to continue to assess the practices and programs that we have in place as a division for students.  Our world is ever changing; the work force and universities demand certain skills and abilities, as a division we have to make sure that we are adapting our programs so that we are preparing our students for the future.\r\n\r\nThirdly, would be to continue to work on our Divisional Communications Plan.  We need to determine the best way to communicate with parents, what information is important, how to share that information in a timely manner, and what role technology plays in that.  Those questions need to be asked and answered for all the stakeholder groups so that we have an effective and efficient means of communication.  \r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThe one thing that I appreciate the most about my ward, the Transcona Ward, is the history, pride and sense of community that we have here in Transcona.  We are truly a community unto ourselves.  To represent the ward of Transcona has been a great honour.  The people of Transcona support public education and have supported me for the past 22 years and for that I am truly grateful. \r\n\r\nAs for the school division of River East Transcona, I truly appreciate the people that work there.  The staff that work within the division are dedicated to making this division the best it can be so that we can educate our students so that they can attain their fullest potential.  We excel in the area of being “educational leaders” in assessment, curriculum implementation, student services, technology, and Early Years intervention.  These accomplishments can only be achieved through the hard work and dedication of the staff of the River East Transcona School Division.\r\n\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI want to thank my community for the privilege they extended to me four years ago.  Serving as your Trustee has been extremely challenging and rewarding.  Given the opportunity, I will continue to dedicate myself wholeheartedly to the role of Trustee, mindful of the concerns of all the partners in education; students, parents, educators, and taxpayers.  The future holds many challenges and issues for education.  You will need an experienced Trustee with a strong voice to ensure that our schools and programs do not diminish.  Our school system must provide quality educational opportunities for every child.  As your Trustee, I will continue to be a strong advocate for our schools.  I will continue to ensure that your tax dollars are spent effectively and efficiently.  \r\nI am committed to:\r\n•\tBeing a full time trustee who is dedicated to representing your interests in a strong and effective manner.\r\n•\tEnsuring fiscal responsibility and accountability to taxpayers by striving to balance the needs and opinions of all those I represent.\r\n•\tProviding our children with a safe, stimulating, and healthy environment in which to learn.\r\n•\tCreating strong partnerships with parents, staff, and the community within the Division.\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":28,"electoral_race_id":78,"created_at":"2014-09-14T02:06:42.703-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-08T16:23:08.763-05:00"},{"id":305,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI am a long time resident and school trustee in the Seven Oaks School Division and have 2 children who attended schools in Seven Oaks.  I have been extensively involved in Seven Oaks as a board member and volunteer.  I am dedicated to this community and its children and want to continue to use the skills and knowledge I have acquired to ensure that every child enjoys success at school and beyond and that the division maximizes children's talents, aptitudes and abilities. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nThe following are some of my experiences: Past Chair-Seven Oaks School Board, Present Vice-Chair, Suburban Director-Manitoba School Boards Association, Former Teacher, Co-Chair-Board Workplace, Safety and Health Committee, Board Policy Chair, Co-chair Board/Teacher Advisory Committee, Founding Board Member and President-7Oaks Education Foundation, Founding Board Member-Kildonan Youth Activity Centre, President-H.C.

Awarded the Governor-General's  Commerative Medal for Community Service. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI believe in an education system that embraces the uniqueness of every child, develops critical thinkers, supports those students who are disadvantaged in some way and has a diversity of programs and opportunities to ensure greater student access to an excellent education in safe caring environments.  To that end, I have advocated for or supported: the award winning MET School, the Wayfinders tutoring program, comprehensive music, arts, sports, after school, preschool and co-operative vocational programs plus the establishment of gay-straight alliances, specific aboriginal and poverty initiatives and professional develpment for staff to help us reach these goals.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nDespite our budget restricions, based on an unfair provincial funding formula, Seven Oaks School Division has been able to provide award winning programs and  vast opportunities for its students that are effective.  We partner with our parents and community organizations to help us reach our goals.  As a result, the division has achieved a 90 percent graduation rate and increased student enrolment in post secondary institutions. \r\n\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\n  I would appreciate your vote on October 22nd.  \r\n I would welcome the opportunity to hear from you and share our ideas for the future of our education system.\r\n                       Please contact me at:\r\n                      Telephone: (204) 339-8758\r\n                       Email: csarbit1@gmail.com \r\n                       Blog: http://csarbit.blogspot.com\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":72,"electoral_race_id":64,"created_at":"2014-09-14T02:30:25.120-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-11T07:25:57.415-05:00"},{"id":306,"questionnaire":"","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":74,"electoral_race_id":64,"created_at":"2014-09-14T02:33:28.365-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-24T01:36:35.587-05:00"},{"id":221,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\n•\tSenior citizens walking on Portage avenue in the middle of traffic because the sidewalks were not cleaned.\r\n•\t80 pound ice chunks deposited on our driveways.

Photo Radar needs to be dismantled and studied if it is ever to be used again for safety and not for revenue.\r\n•\tOur roads and sidewalks are not even being maintained anymore. They are the worst that they have ever been.\r\nIn the same way that Winnipeg leads the world in so many other respects (in human and women’s rights, in business entrepreneurship, in world-class talent, in charitable giving, etc.) we can build on this strong legacy to begin to run our city in a way that better serves its citizens, improves our quality of life, and makes us proud to call this place home.\r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\n\r\nDwight has strong and longstanding professional relationships with a wide range of organizations and individuals, whose trust and respect he has earned over many years. He is known to many as a person not only of his word, but also of action, and subsequently for his ethics and integrity. \r\nFor the past 15 years Dwight has held varying positions of growing responsibility and complexity within the financial services industry. His current role is a Manager, Business Development, which is comprised of building new professional relationships, business partnerships and clients for his employer, an international corporate financial services company. Dwight works with individuals from every sphere of life and from every size of organization, from small ‘mom and pop’ style businesses through to huge, publicly-traded companies from across Canada and the US. \r\nDwight’s experience in both the commercial real-estate and financial sectors has given him experience and keen insights into sound financial management, leasing and development practices, and considerable business acumen – qualities that will serve both the    St. Charles ward, and the city of Winnipeg well in this era of property scandals and pending rapid transit development. Volunteer – many decades of community and regional volunteerism \r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n Attitude change: \r\nWe need to start treating our citizens as customers. This change needs to take root at the top and flow down to every department!\r\nMoney Management:\r\n We need a complete forensic audit done, the type that can trace every penny being spent. Only when we know where our money is going can we build solid plans. Only when we know where every penny is going can we negotiate the expenditure of these funds or the saving of them.\r\nEncourage Saving: \r\nCurrently there is a rush every year at the end of the year to spend all budget money, Why? Well if it is not spent then they funded the following year to the amount that they spend. We need to encourage saving while keeping funding at the same level even though it is not fully spent. This way departments can build up a fund which one day will earn enough interest that these departments will no longer need to be funded by tax dollars.\r\nStreets and sidewalks:\r\nThey need to be cleaned and maintained!  \r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nThe People!\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am the only privately sector employee running in this ward.

I grew increasingly frustrated over what I viewed as gross mismanagement and the failure of some City Council members and senior civic officials to do what is right.  I concluded it was time to take the step to enter the race to replace our current Councillor for St. Charles.  I feel Mr. Nordman is ineffective at representing the residents of our great area of Winnipeg or the city in general.  We need change, which includes a new Councillor for St. Charles who is acting in the best interest of the people of our neighbourhood and not one who is loyal to the Mayor and work only to fulfill their agenda and further their causes.  Mr. Nordman has been well rewarded for his unwavering loyalty, but that is not why St. Charles residents sent him to City Hall.  I believe my knowledge, experience and unwillingness to compromise my integrity equip me to take on what will surely be significant challenges facing the new City Council.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nI have been employed by the Province of Manitoba for 28 years.  I hold the position of Standards Officer with the Procurement Branch - Department of Infrastructure and Transportation.  I am responsible for establishing the standards and developing specifications relating to the goods purchased across all government departments.  This ensures we receive maximum value for the dollars spent by Manitoban’s and that we are purchasing goods which meet or exceed the requirements of national and/or international standards relating to quality and safety.\r\n\r\nIf selected by the residents of St. Charles Ward to be their representative on Winnipeg City Council, I will take this same attitude, work ethic and desire to do what is right with me to City Hall.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nMy integrity, honesty and behaving in a way my family will be proud of are things I am not willing to compromise on and are certainly not for sale.  If successful on October 22nd I will take that belief to City Hall with me and fulfill my responsibilities with integrity and humility.\r\n\r\nI have the experience and willingness to take on the challenge of reviewing and amending the purchasing policies of the City of Winnipeg.  For instance, the Chief Administrative Officer has had the authority to award a non-tendered, single source contract to a developer or supplier up to the value of ten million dollars.  From every angle you view this policy, it is absurd.  The external auditors tasked with reviewing questionable financial decisions made at City Hall agreed and recommended that figure be slashed down to one million dollars.  I believe that spending threshold is still much higher than it should be and I will work to bring this more in line with acceptable practices of other municipalities.  The current policy could easily be used to undermine the proven and accepted practice of fair and transparent competition through the open tendering process and I feel this needs fixing.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nThis is an amazing part of Winnipeg.  So many of the residents grew up in this neighbourhood and when it came time to start our own families and purchase a home, we stay and do so here.  This speaks to the attitude we have about our neighbourhood and the quality of life we enjoy.  To represent St. Charles ward at Winnipeg City Council would be such an honour and I would serve with tremendous respect and humility for the privilege to do so.\r\n\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nAfter working in government for 28 years, I feel I have the experience and skill to navigate what can certainly be a challenging and cumbersome bureaucracy.\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":57,"electoral_race_id":52,"created_at":"2014-08-16T02:46:39.001-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-29T05:43:08.100-05:00"},{"id":250,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nAs a parent, I have bore witness to the importance of public education, and feel--despite the LRSD's numerous successes--there is still much to be improved upon. Over the next few years, the LRSD will face a number of challenges (population growth, financing, accommodating the K-3 initiative, etc), and I want to assist the Division in effectively addressing these challenges while ensuring our children receive quality educations.  \r\n\r\nOver the past year, community members have expressed dissatisfaction with the Division's communication and consultation efforts, specifically through two critical transitions (Ecole Marie-Anne-Gaboury/Hastings School; Ecole Julie Riel/Ecole St. Germaine/George McDowell School). Once \"the dust settled,\" I came to realize  much more could have been done proactively to ease the fear, anger, and angst in the community.\r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nOn a day to day basis, I work with diverse groups on local, national, and international levels. I have a proven track record of encouraging public engagement, and have successfully implemented a number of programs in Winnipeg's publishing community. I am an engaged community volunteer, having served on the parent committee at my daughter's school for the past eight years (the past two as president), on the board of my daughter's preschool, as well as being a community coordinator and canvasser for the Heart and Stroke Foundation. \r\n\r\nA communications professional, I have extensive experience in developing effective communication materials, in a number of mediums. Communication is a two-way street, and I am an effective listener who consults and researches prior to making to crucial decisions.\r\n\r\nAs an arts administrator, I have a great deal of proficiency in lobbying, and in developing and managing budgets. Having served on a number of boards and committees in Winnipeg's arts and publishing communities through the years, I have extensive knowledge about governance and administration.\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nOne of the single-best ways to build nurturing school communities is through parent involvement. I want the Division to be proactive in broadening parent councils, while expanding upon its initiatives to engage community members in the governance process. I will expect each of my colleagues to be visible in our schools, be it at parent committee meetings or events, while actively engaging with community members. \r\n\r\nDespite the the K-3 initiative, the provincial government did not increase its funding to LRSD. I believe it's important to lobby for funding increases, as property taxes should not be the emphasis when funding public education.\r\n\r\nThere are changing demographics in the Division (increased enrollment in some schools, decreased enrollment in others; housing developments; immigration). Is the LRSD meeting the needs of each and every student? Ongoing assessment is needed, and should be prioritized.\r\n\r\nNo student should feel marginalized because of ability, gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion. I believe in inclusive education, and feel programming for the Division’s Indigenous and recently immigrated students is crucial. I believe every school should be safe, and will encourage administrators and staff to participate in LGBTTQ and cultural sensitivity training and education programs. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI am grateful the LRSD is progressive, forward thinking, and at the forefront  with regards to French Immersion education. I appreciate the diversity of our community, schools, students and educators.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am looking forward to building upon relationships to effectively serve our schools, educators, community, parents, and most importantly, our students.

This is an issue that's near and dear to me because in grade 11 I came out of the closest and I was supported by all my family and friends but that's not always the case for some kids and for those kids they need a place to feel safe and a school should be that place. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI appreciate how connected ward 1/Winnipeg sxhool division is, I grew up in the River Heights community and it's like one big family.

I should also like to see every high school in Louis Riel School Division have a proper stage and theatre for drama productions.I encourage teachers and principals who are willing to organize travel/field trips beyond the school walls.. locally, across Canada, or overseas.\r\n\r\nI question why schools have so many PD days where students have to stay home while teachers sit and partake in reams of edubabble, instead of being in class with their students.

In divisions with dual track systems, the French is often marginalized and , by sheer weight of the mainstream language, dual track becomes back burner...with a very weak flame.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nIf you elect me you will have a trustee who will tell it like it is, no fudging, and one who will not support wasting money on a top heavy bureaucracy. Also, I will support a superintendent and principals who have the character to make firm decisions in what can sometimes be a situation where it is difficult to placate everybody. We have such leaders now, and from time to time they will need to feel they are backed by the elected people who sit on the school board and make policy.\r\n Finally, I encourage school administrators to find time to escape being captive to the blue lights of their computer monitors and , daily, to spend some time in the halls, classrooms and grounds of the schools in their charge. The effect on the staff, students and themselves will be positive.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":105,"electoral_race_id":67,"created_at":"2014-09-11T00:16:23.977-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-28T22:41:54.818-05:00"},{"id":370,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI have enjoyed my time representing the residents of Ward One in Seine River School Division since first being elected in 2002. For the past 12 years, I have been active at both the divisional and community level. I remain passionate regarding the role of public education in preparing students to be responsible and contributing citizens in their communities.

Additionally, I bring my experience as a leader and board member in various community organizations in Manitoba and Canada.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI am a strong believer in inclusion, and will continue to advocate passionately for a continued emphasis on inclusion in all schools. Normalizing the educational experience for students with special needs has proven to result in improved outcomes for all. I also believe strongly in the importance of providing expert psychosocial and emotional support for students as part of the educational experience. We continue to experience new challenges in our communities in this regard. I believe we need to continue to partner with other community stakeholders in order to ensure we are in the best place possible to respond to the growing mental health concerns of our students; this will need to involve continued emphasis on stigma reduction and education on mental illness and mental health for both students and staff alike.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI believe that our Board has proven to be innovative and open to new ideas. This has meant working closely with our senior administration team and ensuring that the lines of communication between employee groups and the board are open and that dialogue is ongoing. While we have a strong track record in this regard, all partners will need to continue to work to find ways to improve communication and dialogue toward improving the quality of the educational opportunities we provide for the students in our division. We are fortunate that parent involvement is strong in our Division and we boast many active Parent Advisory Councils. The Board needs to continue the connection with these community based groups in order to ensure the way forward is consistent with the concerns and goals of local communities and their families.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI have a proven track record for providing timely response to questions and issues for the residents in Ward One. I will continue to advocate at the Board level for improvements based on evidence and support to community and grass roots level initiatives which are student-centered and represent improvements for public education in Manitoba.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":309,"electoral_race_id":82,"created_at":"2014-09-19T00:12:02.372-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-28T22:50:38.943-05:00"},{"id":275,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nSchool boards are comprised of citizens who invest significantly to ensure that the children in their communities are well-served with programs and supports that respect unique local needs. They develop partnerships with their community, while they honour the values of stewardship. They make \"tough\" decisions at the local level to serve all students' best interests, even through some decisions will not receive universal support. I want to be part of that decision making process. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI have been a school trustee for 26 years. I've chaired all education standing committee's. I'm the present Chair of the Louis Riel School Board and a Past President of the Manitoba School Board Association\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nAll issues are important when it effects children's education. They are the future of this country. Enhancing children's learning capacity should be at the top of everyone's list. Politics won't go away but we can try to minimize its impact on what is good for children. We must speak as a community with one voice on educational matters.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThe Louis Riel School Division have been progressive thinkers, doing the right thing for what is required for all student's education. The school ward parent is well versed in what is needed for their children's education along with the combined effort of working together in a teamwork atmosphere from within the divisional community.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nServing the educational community as a school trustee for 26 yrs., dealing with a very large educational division budget.

I have a college diploma as well as a Certificate in Adult Education from the University of Manitoba.  I continually attend workshops and training to enhance my learning and understanding of education principles and philosophy, education finances, etc.  My work experience in the worlds of both child care and family services give me a very broad understanding of the issues facing children, families and schools. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nAccountability - the Board is entrusted with funding for education through both provincial and local taxation.  It is our responsibility to balance providing a strong / fair education for our children with ensuring funds are spent efficiently and effectively.\r\n\r\nOpenness and Accessibility - it is very important that all stakeholders in education feel that they can approach not just their local trustee, but their school board with their ideas and concerns.  The Board must be responsible to listen and understand concerns, but still to act in the best interests of the whole division.  \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nSeine River School Division is an awesome division!

I will continue to champion neighbourhood planning to help guide new development while protectiong the character of our older neighbourhoods.  I also believe we must work with other partners to tackle the issue the lack of affordable rental accommodation and  the issue of  homelessness in our city.

I was disappointed that my trustees wouldn't even take the time to return my calls and address my concerns. I took to social media and discovered many other parents have had the same problem. That's when I decided to run for trustee and encourage other parents to do the same. As tax payers and parents I strongly believe we deserve a voice in policies that directly effect our children. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nThe main advantage for experience I have over the other candidates is actually having school aged children. When I went back to university last year, it was extremely different from the last time I attended classes in 2002. Technology has enriched the learning experience so much, and is a vital tool! I also bring front line experience to the table as I currently work with special needs children in another school. In addition I have also worked for Winnipeg Regional Health Authority for 12 years. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI would like to see breakfast clubs in all our schools. I have seen first hand the difference they can make and believe in the program so much, I'm going to give part of any honorarium I receive to this program. \r\n\r\n I will also stand for special education programs that are student focused, strict anti bully policy, more teacher to parent communication,free preschool, accountability from administrators, better bussing,modern technology in all classes, ensuring sensory rooms aren't used in a abusive manor and no tax increases.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nOur school division has some of the best teachers! \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nIf I am elected I am going to put the TRUST back in trustee! \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":250,"electoral_race_id":61,"created_at":"2014-09-13T01:44:49.124-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-29T17:01:41.067-05:00"},{"id":271,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nI have a deep and abiding passion for this city, its people, and its institutions. I have been raised to believe that public service is the highest calling, and that working to improve our community and society is an obligation for all those who are able. My father met his obligation to serve by flying a C130 Hercules in the Canadian Air Force. After obtaining my Bachelor of Arts in Political Studies, I worked in the private sector to gain valuable experience. Now that I have established myself, and learned many valuable life lessons, I'm ready to fulfill my obligation by working to improve St. Boniface specifically, and the City of Winnipeg as a whole.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nMy background in the private sector will be a valuable asset to my work as city councillor. As a result of my experience in sales and marketing, I have formed strong relationships in the business community in this city, especially small business owners. Through these relationships, I have been able to gain insight into the challenges that small business owners face on a daily basis. I will seek to address those issues, in particular, streamlining the permit and licensing processes wherever possible.\r\n\r\nIn addition, my marketing background will help me to promote the city, and especially St. Boniface, in order to attract businesses, tourists, and families looking for a vibrant, energized place to settle down. I will also work to more fully integrate the St. Boniface business community, especially around the Provencher Bridge and l'Esplanade Riel into the burgeoning new developments downtown and in the Exchange District.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nWe know that the incoming City Council will look vastly different from the outgoing one. This will provide an excellent and rare opportunity to re-shape our civic governance. The past decade has seen City Hall plagued by scandal and impropriety.\r\n\r\nI will work with the new Council to re-claim City Hall as a chamber of and for the people of Winnipeg. In order to regain the trust of the people, we need to re-establish a sense of transparency and accountability for our elected representatives and civic officials. My focus will be on establishing records of all debates and votes in Council, and making them publicly available online and in hard copy, as well as entirely searchable.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nThe thing I appreciate most about the ward is its diversity. It goes without saying that the history and rich francophone heritage make St. Boniface exciting and vital, and a community unique in Canada, if not the world. However, the ward extends beyond old St. Boniface and includes such distinct areas as Windsor Park, Island Lakes, Royalwood, and Sage Creek. Each area has its own distinct character, as well as its own unique set of economic, cultural and infrastructure priorities. Representing all of the people of the ward is a unique challenge, and I hope I have the opportunity to meet that challenge.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am the best candidate for the people of St. Boniface because I am running to represent them, not any special interest group, and not any political party machine. I have a vision for the ward, and the city. Ideas matter. Policy matters. This is not a vanity campaign, but a campaign based on structured, thought-out ideas and how to make them work best for the people of St. Boniface. Artful rhetoric alone isn't enough to improve the quality of our lives. Neither is vision without being grounded in reason. I believe strongly in vision with reason, not rhetoric. My ideas are grounded in reality. They are pragmatic, possible, and not based on partisan dogma. My vision can be achieved, and if the people of St. Boniface elect me, I will work tirelessly to achieve it.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":242,"electoral_race_id":51,"created_at":"2014-09-12T23:08:22.684-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-29T19:31:50.393-05:00"},{"id":218,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nI ran in the 2011 by-election in St. Vital because I believed our city needed a change of direction. It was apparent at that time there were deficiencies in the way City Hall was being managed. In the past three years the city has not progressed under the current leadership, but regressed. In discussions with citizens in St. Vital it was apparent that they were tired of what has been going on at City Hall. Scandals, fiscal mismanagement, lack of follow up and transparency, poor leadership and lack of infrastructure renewal were a few of the issues that were at the forefront. The current administration and the Councillor in St. Vital we’re not a part of the solution but the problem.\r\n\r\nPeople across Winnipeg are motivated by change this time around. We cannot have the ‘Yes’ men and people with self-interests leading our city. The incredible lack of innovation, creativity and courage to move our city forward has plagued not only St. Vital but our entire City. I want to be a Councillor who will stand up for people again, be open and transparent and not place political partisanship and special interests ahead of the average everyday citizen.  \r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nAs a father of two, a longtime resident of St. Vital and recent board member of a local community centre I am committed to working with my community to build a vibrant, inclusive and prosperous city. \r\n\r\nI bring the experience of working on Boards and Committees that address the needs of people. My work as an advocate for people for the past 15 years has helped establish a sound mechanism in which I can work from when dealing with citizen concerns. My diverse background includes working with First Nations Youth, Youth in care, Post-Secondary students, the inner city, a crown corporation and people with life challenges. This has furthered my understanding in working in complex and diverse environments. \r\n\r\nI was a volunteer citizen for the St. Vital Health Advisory and Patient Health Advisory Committees and University of Manitoba Board of Governors. I currently sit on the Winnipeg Committee for Safety and Citizen Equity committee. I am also a University Graduate as well as having skills training as a Trainer/Facilitator and Business Management. These experiences provide me with a broad range of skills that allow me to innovative, creative and forward thinking\r\n\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nAccountability and transparency are critical to building a sustainable city. These have been lacking at City Hall. There has been very little work to champion this issue. It has created mistrust in our Civic governance. I want to rebuild the trust and integrity that our citizens deserve. I will do that by putting our citizens first and push away favoritism towards political partisanship and special interest. I want to work with everyone and build a city that we will be proud of for years to come.\r\n\r\nSound fiscal mismanagement has been an ongoing concern for tax payers.  Why have our City Councillors including the incumbent in St. Vital been spending our money without sound judgment? How can we accept major cost overruns and scandal as a way of doing business? Citizens across St. Vital are tired of paying more and want quality services and follow up. They want our money to go back into core infrastructure projects. \r\n\r\nIssues such as safety, back lanes, rapid transit, and snow clearing are also at the forefront. Citizens feel like they are being ignored and not provided enough services for the taxes they pay. Lets get back to working with you.\r\n\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nI appreciate many things about my home, the rich history, stories, community centres and green space. I have many memories of curling out of the St. Vital curling club and spending hours tirelessly working out at the Y and hours of biking along the Seine, St. Vital Park and down Kingston Row. Going to the great restaurants and spending hours at St. Vital mall after University classes. We have amazing seniors, great school programs and an incredible businesses sector that enhances our community. \r\n\r\nIt is hard to appreciate just one thing about a community you have grown to love. Living on Ashworth, Bonita, St.Annes and Regal you take in so much about our busy, active and growing neighborhoods. You see new young families making St. Vital their home. You admire the incredible legacy of our hockey and curling programs. You see the difference our community makes in developing our neighborhoods and the diversity of bringing new people into our great part of the city. \r\n\r\nIf there is one thing i appreciate more than anything, is that it’s my home and i would live nowhere else.\r\n\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nWe have a choice to make this election. Do we vote for the same status quo candidate who is a yes person to the mayor? Do want someone who will stand up for citizens when they want to be heard or turn a blind eye in favor political partisanship, special and self-interest? Do we want a Councillor who takes every opportunity to get their face in the paper? Or do we want a Councillor who wants you at the forefront of the community. Do we support incumbents who are supported by political parties?  Or do we want a Councillor who stands up for everyone.\r\n\r\nThis election is about saying no to scandals and fiscal mismanagement. It’s about saying no to over spending our tax dollars and poor political ethics. This election is about the future of our city. To elect the same political party supported politician will only keep us where we are. Winnipeg wants change and your current incumbent in St. Vital does not equate to change. I am asking you to vote for someone who loves this city and wants to put it back on track so we can leave a future for our kids and grand-kids.\r\n\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":180,"electoral_race_id":54,"created_at":"2014-07-18T23:42:50.027-05:00","updated_at":"2014-09-30T06:32:40.604-05:00"},{"id":273,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI've been happy and proud to serve as a school trustee here for the last four years and am running for re-election. Four years ago I decided to run because my children were entering the school system and wanted to make a positive difference. I was active with our parents group and daycare board before becoming a trustee. I am a lawyer, but my parents were both teachers and I grew up with a solid knowledge of educational issues.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI have gained a lot of experience during my time on the board. I have chaired the Education and Policy committees and am currently the Finance Chair. In that role, I guided and shaped our division's budget and learned a great deal about how our finances operate. As a practicing criminal lawyer, I have a great deal of experience dealing with people and complex issues which is very valuable to the board. My parents were both teachers and I grew up with a solid knowledge of educational issues.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI will prioritize responsible budgeting. We have kept taxes low in tough times by shifting spending from administration to the class room. School safety is also important. We have introduced anti-bullying and human diversity policies. I would also stress equal access to education. I believe everyone deserves the best chance to succeed. Finally, I would stress ensuring that all our students have strong literacy and numeracy skills. We have put in place standards to ensure that our goals in these areas are being met.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI very much appreciate the strong sense of community that I have found in our ward and our division.

Another reason I decided to run for School Trustee is that I want to protect program funding for art, music, and trades classes as well as increasing the number of French immersion spaces available in the Division. \r\n\r\nI also felt a strong desire to help repay my community for the excellent education I received in the Division. \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nAs a professional communication officer, I will bring a strong interpersonal and problem solving skills to the School Board.

I will work to increase the level of detail found in School Board meeting minutes as well as reducing the restrictions on public presentations and questions at meetings. These changes are important to me as I want decisions regarding the education of our children to be made using solid research and considering the needs of all stakeholders. \r\n\r\nWithout detailed minutes and and questions from the public, decisions are being made with too little input from parents and students, as well as the community at large.

The more students that graduate and move on to higher forms of education can only benefit society in untold ways. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nSchool safety issues are my number one concern.  I have witnessed dangerous situations almost daily and I would really like to see some changes in that aspect. \r\nSome of my other concerns include: continual tax increases, large class sizes, new schools not being built and lack of day care spaces.   \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nPride in our community.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am enjoying the experience so far, I am meeting new people, listening to concerns in the community and getting allot of exercise. \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":238,"electoral_race_id":78,"created_at":"2014-09-12T00:27:26.087-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-01T11:03:48.047-05:00"},{"id":333,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nThe Louis Riel School Division is well governed and administered; but it took a lot of \"blood, sweat and tears\" to arrive at this point since the amalgamation in 2002. However, there is always room for improvement and new opportunities present new challenges for enhancing public education. When boards are, \"knowledgeable, informed, skillful and resourceful, interdependent and proactive, they use their collective wisdom to drive the school division toward excellence\", (M. Rosenberger, MSBA. 2012.). The School Board must be cognizant that its collective wisdom is derived and developed from respective collaboration and cooperation of a group of individual trustees working in harmony with its community towards a defined goal.\r\nI look forward to continued participation in ensuring stron governance in Louis Riel School Division for our greater community by developing further the four pillars of good governance: stewardship, leadership, responsibility and accountabilty.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nMy career has been very diversified...just like our schools and students. I have been employed as a flight operations agent with Delta airlines, an entrepreneur in the retail grocery business, and finally as a teaching principal i the Sunrise School Division instructing students from grades 5 to 12 in a multi-age Englishj immersion educational setting. I have served on the Board at the Winnipeg Technical College and as Chair of the Technical Vocational Education Committee in the Louis Riel School Division In addition, I have also served on many committees in boththe former St.Vital School Division No.6 and currently in the Louis Riel School Division. I am an advocate for solid English Program and French Immersion Program education. In addition, I believe in technical vocational education and strongly feel that students must have access to technical vocational programs to engage in meaningful learning thereby maximizing their opportunities in the work world after their journey through our public schools.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI would like to ensure accountability in education to our community. Why? There has been a media focus on internatinal test results that indicate Manitoba's children are not as successful as those in other provinces. We need to ensure that our schools are preparing chidren for the future in all subject areas.\r\nI would like to expand our English as an Additional Language to include support for newcomer parents in their struggle to enhance their language skills. Why? Stronger language skills leads to better job opportunities, independence and support of their children's language development.\r\nOur increasing Aboriginal student enrolment in Louis Riel requires appropriate programming to connect Aboriginal students with school and permit them to harmonize their culture with public education. Why? Relevant and appropriate programming will lead to a higher graduation rate and independence.\r\n\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nYou can read the complete answers from Dave Richardson on Facebook\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nYes, a proposal.\r\nI would like to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of our educational delivery by surveying secondary graduates 2 to 3 years after they have settled into post-secondary education, trade schools, apprenticeship programs, or jobs. We need to learn more from our former students. Did the Division prepare its graduates to be successful in their choices? Did the Division help students become engaged in their learning and model good citizenship skills?\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":108,"electoral_race_id":67,"created_at":"2014-09-14T15:02:09.850-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-02T08:56:25.216-05:00"},{"id":224,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nI have lived my life in the service of my community wherever I find my home.  I doubt that will change.  I am better able to serve my neighbours, the people of Winnipeg, if granted the honour of their trust and of their expectations through their vote.  I know a better way to manage people and assets.  The circus at City Hall has left me with a sense of a calling that I am answering.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nMy experience as West-Central Mutual Aid Fire and Life Safety Public Education Co-ordinator has taught me the importance of having both a knowledgeable government and an educated population.\r\nMy experience as a firefighter and as an ambulance attendant has taught me the importance of preventative measures (mechanical/educational/structural/procedural) to at once reduce harm and increase financial savings.\r\nMy experience asserting what I believe to be my human rights as well as those under the Canadian Constitution has brought me an understanding of the burden of injustice and shown me the ugliness of socio-economic blaming and prejudice.\r\nMy experience as a mobility-impaired person has taught me the difficulties of accessing public spaces and shops and restaurants to satisfy human social needs.  The cost of being a mobility-impaired (sudden- or gradual onset) person trying to accomplish the same tasks an able Winnipegger is not clearly understood until lived or thoroughly explained.\r\nMy experience as a shut-in isolated from human contact in the middle of a busy city and too poor and broken to go anywhere has taught me strength of Faith and the importance of pursuing virtuous behaviours and thought.  Virtues are universal and eternal.  Respect for Science is respect for Faith.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI would like to put in place policies and procedures to minimize the effects of economic disparity -- especially currently with regard to the matter of year-round safe accessibility to and on our sidewalks.  This issue is of special concern to me because I have watched as newly fallen snow on our publicly maintained sidewalks does not get cleared until after it gets trampled and the surfaces turn into frozen icy craterous tracts of treacherousness.  Most of the people in Point Douglas Ward walk or cycle to get around.  This issue affects the ability of any person to safely access the community mail boxes the federal government is foisting upon the municipal populations, to safely get to work or to school or to the heavily promoted public transportation system.  Unsafe paths are more heavily burdensome to an aging demographic who may become seasonally isolated as well as are likely to suffer more serious injury in event of a spill.  We need policies and procedures that allow equal access to basic human needs: security, shelter, socialization, clean water, clean air, economical nutritious food, and current technologies.  This is important to me as a way to entrench human rights into everyday culture.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nOne thing I particularly appreciate is the harmonious respectful nature in the interactive connections continually found between the seemingly at-odds elements in our ward.  Unification of intent while refusing to bend to the destructive negativism perpetuated by many media outlets is the best way to our professed preferred destination, if the goal be manifestation of truth and love and understanding in every situation.  The intelligence bank and artistic talent found here in one person or in several is much akin to finding diverse gems housed in an organic grout of hope, respect and understanding, to be polished by the grains of encouragement, enrichment, and empowerment.  The potential exists for all peoples to appreciate and then to replicate the forward-thinking culture we are continuously working at trying to perfect here in our ward.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am called to educate and to lead.  My preferred method is to teach and to lead by example.  Anybody with money VOTES EVERY DAY with their dollar.  I shop at Canadian owned stores because I VOTE FOR universal healthcare and Canadian moral ideals.  My shadow does not cross the doorway of American-owned Wal-Mart, Target, others because I VOTE AGAINST the Military-Industrial Complex and Guantanamo Bay.  Think globally, act locally - a motto I take to heart in thought and behaviour.  All humans die.  The Government, however, lives on well after we are gone and will continue to affect those who survive us.  I demonstrate my LOVE FOR FUTURE LIVES, whether they are human, insect, other, by putting a little mark on a piece of paper.  Voting: so easy to do, means so much more than the effort involved.  Avoiding human rights transgression exposure - by any organ of society - has barbaric consequence.  Self-Selecting Socio-Economic Extremist Religious Sects (SSSEERS) and their philosophy followers deserve to have their income diminished.  Winnipeggers can prove understanding the truth that when humans are stripped of rights, exceptional financial reward is provided to the violators.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":216,"electoral_race_id":49,"created_at":"2014-08-01T01:41:01.367-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-04T13:37:02.537-05:00"},{"id":285,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI am seeking re-election as I am very much interested in supporting school programming that is in keeping with our community values. I am committed to supporting the needs of our students while making the best use of our tax dollars to ensure quality education is provided and maintained for ALL students.  \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI have served on the Board for a number of years including Chairperson 2009 -2013. I believe my experience on the Board and in business as a corporate lawyer are attributes that will complement the skills and background of other Board members.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI continue to support literacy initiatives and numeracy skills enhancements particularly for students in the elementary school age category in support of the learning of 'fundamentals' that leads to better student performance in middle and high school.  \r\n\r\nOur schools must continue to provide a safe educational setting for our students to learn and develop. To that end, I wholeheartedly endorsed and continue to support the participation of our school division in the Winnipeg Poice Service School Resource Officer (SRO) program that provides visible law enforcement in support of our schools.  \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThe support of the Arts in particular is one area where St.James-Assiniboia School Division stands out in particular. I am very impressed by the energy and enthusiasm of students in embracing the opportunities offered in the various Arts programs at the school and divison level. The keen support of parents and the community in this regard is a credit to all.   \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI continue to be committed to serving the needs of our students and community and pledge to do so with an open, positive and caring approach.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":54,"electoral_race_id":61,"created_at":"2014-09-13T01:36:20.744-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-01T16:17:11.411-05:00"},{"id":295,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nHaving worked for the school division for just under twenty-five years, and lived in the area for forty years.

I have a strong political background, understanding and knowledge to be a great School Trustee.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI have been and still am a long time Vice President of Cupe Local 110. I am well experienced and educated in negotiations, individual representations, benefits and pension plan issues as well as human rights and in fact have represented and have been educated in most labour / human rights issues. Having been involved in public school politics I've seen the need for an educated staff and leaders to work together to bring education to a front. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI will work to keep our taxes as low as possible but not at the expense of the children living in this area or the staff working for the Seven Oakes School Divisions. I support public use of our school buildings and public daycare. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI have lived in Ward 2 of Seven Oakes School Division for 40 years and have raised two children here.

As a community member and working within the system, I feel that this is a natural progression for me to continue my passion for the promotion of education as a school trustee.  \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI feel that it is important that a school board have representatives with experiences from working within a classroom.  From my work as a teacher, I would bring an understanding of classroom issues, ongoing educational research, and policy development.  Specific areas of work in schools that I have been involved with include social justice, appropriate educational programming and Aboriginal education.  As a teacher association executive, I have worked with superintendents, school trustees and teachers to create a supportive work environment, and schools that welcome all students.

It involves communication with teachers, administrators, clinicians and other support staff to ensure our students have the resources needed to excel in school.  The Division needs to continue its work on creating safe and inclusive schools by addressing issues of equity and social justice.  The Division needs to continue developing strong ties with post-secondary institutions to assist with student career opportunities.  There also needs to be greater community input into divisional decisions, as some of these decisions have a great impact on students such as the recent move to include grade 9 at River East Collegiate and subsequent reconfiguration of feeder schools.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nRiver East Transcona has a long history of academic excellence and high graduation rates.

I’m not entirely satisfied with what is happening in our school district and with our school board, so I have decided to run. I think my 17 years experience as a teacher will be extremely beneficial to the position.  I am running in Ward 2 because I am a resident of the ward. I feel it is unfair that three out of the five candidates in Ward 2 do not live in the ward. \r\n\r\nMy two children have spent their whole academic lives as residents of RETSD. We have great teachers in the RETSD, and I want to see that they get the support they need to deliver the best program they can to their students.\r\n\r\n From attending school board meetings, it seemed to me that there was underlying conflict between trustees and not enough collaboration and compromise, which saw good ideas defeated.  I want to create an atmosphere of dialogue and respect.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI have been a school teacher for 17 years, teaching from Nursery level up to grade 9 in those years. Having that experience, I know the different challenges that teachers face at each level, and what resources they require. As well, I have lived in the River East-Transcona school division for almost 20 years. I attended schools in RETSD, and so did my wife Linda. Our two boys have spent all their lives as students in RETSD. I have the perspective of a parent and a property owner and taxpayer. Living in Ward 2 I have had a chance to discuss issues with neighbours who have shared their concerns on what is happening in the division.  \r\n\r\nI have also been attending school board meetings when I could during the 2013-2014 board meetings, and reading the minutes from each board meeting for the year to keep up with issues that the school board was dealing with. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n-An examination of upper management positions in the division to see if some positions can be integrated with others. Is it necessary to have five superintendents, or could we integrate positions together to save the division $200 000 or more each year?\r\n\r\n-Setting up students for success in technology. The RETSD budget provides for around $500 000 for equipment for schools. However there is a disparity in use and instruction with the equipment between schools. I want to ensure that the school board provides funding for professional development for teachers in the use and implementation of the technology equally in all classes at all levels.\r\n\r\n-Promoting a \"bottom up\" model in our division's educational system.  Our teachers are our best resource and their wide variety of experiences and abilities should be used, rather than bringing in consultants from outside the division.  \r\n\r\n-Encouraging \"Inclusive Sport\": Everybody has a chance to play. At the middle and senior years levels, students drop out of school sports due to the anxiety at failing at at try-outs. Students are also added to teams, but end up sitting on the bench for the whole season. Inclusionary sport will allow all students to play. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nOur school ward has a very diverse population. We have a number of retirement and assisted living homes with seniors who have worked hard supporting our communities. We have older areas, and brand new areas, with an increasing population. Ethnic diversity has risen sharply in the past 5 years, with many new immigrant families moving into the ward. The ward also has a diverse economic diversity, with upper-salary homeowners to people living at the poverty level trying to make rent each month. You can't put a label on this ward, unless it says \"diverse.\"\r\n\r\nThe RETSD has excellent teachers that are equal to any in the province. They are very hard working, and want the best for their students. The amount to parental involvement in the division is impressive. We have parents volunteering in schools, working in lunch programs, and even in numeracy programs within the schools. Many parents have moved on to educational assistant or teaching jobs in the division because they volunteered  in schools and found they loved working with the staff and students in the schools. \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI entered this race to be the local voice for people in my ward. I believe that the voters in this ward should have a local candidate that is familiar with the area, and understands it's needs and issues.\r\n\r\n If elected I know it could be challenging convincing other board members to support the ideas I campaigned for.

However, after talking with my family and neighbours, they encouraged me to put my name on the ballot.  They reminded me of all of the time I spend volunteering with children through my church and when my children were still in school, at their school library, as well as the week-long Harry Potter day camps I still put on in my own back yard every summer.  I have always had an interest in children’s education, and have wanted them to live up to their potential.  Running for school trustee is a better fit than I had originally thought. I come with no personal agenda except to move the LRSD forward to be an excellent school district.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nIn 2001 I started working for United Way of Winnipeg in the finance department.  I understand the big picture, which is the need to do more with less and the need for good fiscal judgment. I also have significant governing board experience having been on the Unifor, formerly CEP, Local 191 executive board since 2010 and have been the Secretary Treasurer since 2012.  \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI believe in the equal and fair treatment of all students. That being said I also believe that children are individuals and do not learn at the same level or pace.  Some children are visual learners while some are tactile learners. It is because of this, or rather the lack of identifying this that causes some children to fall through the cracks.  It is our duty and those of the professionals to identify those children who are at risk and find a better way to educate them.  Children have a right to an education and it is our job to see they get it.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nWow, this is a difficult question.  I am finding it very hard to narrow it down to one particular thing.  If I have to choose only one, I would have to say it is the rich cultural heritage of Ward 1.  \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nWhether it is overcrowded classrooms or under funded programs, there is a way to unravel the problems, however, there needs to be a voice in place that will look out for the interests of our children and educators.

First, I have the educational background to do the job well, holding a PhD in education (music) and an MBA. Second, I have two decades of experience as a teacher, researcher, and consultant in the education sector, and am well versed in the joys and challenges of public education. Third, my active lifestyle and flexible consulting schedule leave me with the time and energy to dedicate myself to the position of Trustee. It's one thing to get elected, and another to do the job well.\r\n\r\nOne final factor, shared by many parents and friends, motivated me to run: I want to ensure that the Winnipeg School Division is led by people who are passionate about education. I have no political ambitions, and this isn't a stepping stone for me. Education is my passion.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nMy experience includes 20 years of teaching and research, working with students of all ages (8-80+) and supervising 21 new teachers.

I cherish the experience I had sharing the first three years of my son's life as a stay-at-home father.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nWinnipeg's schools are doing a good job now, and I don't believe that radical change is needed. My first priority is nutrition and healthy living for all members of the school community. It's hard to nurture a healthy mind in a troubled body. Second, schools need to ensure that classes provide engaging experiences for all students, regardless of background, social status, or other factors. The Winnipeg School Division needs to focus on this: inspired teachers are inspiring teachers. Third, we need to continue to work in finding a balance between short-term job training and more long-term ideals. Education should open minds as well as doors.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nWard 1 is striking in its diversity.

I worked as a Jr. High school teacher for a number of years, and currently work as an instructor at the University of Manitoba.  Because I worked on the front line of the education system, I understand the strengths and challenges of our schools and the unique day-to-day concerns that face educators and students - but I also know what a teaching victory looks like!  As a university instructor, I see bright and dedicated university students who are frustrated that their learning wasn't more rigorous.

I believe that the programs we currently have in place are beneficial.  However, I recognize that there is always room for improvement.  I grew up in Seven Oaks and I went to school in this division.  Now that I have my own family here, I want to give back to the community that helped shape me into the person that I am today.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nBeing the only province in Canada where the School Trustees set the taxation rate, I will push for a change in how the Public School system is funded so it is less of a burden on the ratepayer.  I am a firm advocate for transparency and accountability.  I will strive for an open and fair budget process.\r\n\r\nI look forward to bringing my unique and innovative solutions to the Seven Oaks SchooI Board Office.  As a representative of the new generation, my fresh perspective can bring forth the positive changes that our community needs.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":251,"electoral_race_id":63,"created_at":"2014-09-13T02:17:09.280-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-10T11:16:44.823-05:00"},{"id":269,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI believe its important to give back to the community and I feel I can contribute to enhancing our children's education.   My family and I have attended schools in the River East Transcona School Division and we have lived in this area all our lives. Therefore, I am familiar with the division's needs, understand the education system as well as the challenges that students and teachers face.   I have volunteered in the community, as a Coach and Convenor for Gateway Community Center and various charities all my life and I feel that serving the public's needs on the school board is an extension of that volunteerism.  \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nFirst of all, my career is in education .  I have also had several years experience as a school trustee in the past and understand the workings of the board and the division.  My background and experience as a educator will complement my role as a School Trustee.  My immediate family and extended family have attended or are attending schools in the RETSD.  Therefore I  understand first hand what the needs are.   \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI believe it is very important to form  partnerships between the school division and the business community, as well as other academic institutions. Meeting and learning from these important stakeholders will help us prepare students for future employment.  \r\nBecause there are so many careers available for students to take, it is necessary for the Division to keep on top of those opportunities.    \r\n\r\nI have worked as an educator for many years in Corrections with both youth and adults.  Issues such as gangs, drugs, poverty and lack of education cause many to make bad choices.  I would like to bring this experience, working with other groups to come up with solutions to help our student to make the right decisions. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThe School Division is always open to talk to parents and members of the community to listen to their concerns and suggestions. Also, I have found our community always want to be involved with the education of their children.  This co-operation helps our division to be successful.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nIf you vote for me, I promise I will represent the community's interests related to the RETSD.

That is unacceptable and rather than complain, I decided to do something about it and with the support of my friends, families and neighbours the decision to run for city council was an easy one.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nI have spent eight years as a school trustee (2 years as chairperson) and 27 years as a registered nurse where I learned that an inquisitive and hands-on approach is how to get things done. I am straightforward, honest and when I don't have the answer immediately, I will always get back to you as quickly as possible.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nEvery community within Old Kildonan has different specific issues, whether it is poor waste and water infrastructure, neglect for green spaces and roads, but the theme I have heard from my neighbours living in the ward has been that when people needed help there was no one there for them. I will commit to everyone in Old Kildonan that I will return your phone calls and that I will be an active voice on city council for the growing issues that are facing our community.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nI appreciate the diversity of Old Kildonan. There has been nothing more enjoyable in this campaign than meeting with people from different cultural, linguistic, religious, and ethnic backgrounds and finding that common ground that brings us together. I have worked hard, visiting with people at their community centres, their temples and churches, and their cultural celebrations because I understand that it is important to engage with all constituents of Old Kildonan so that I can bring their concerns to the fore.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI have worked hard throughout this campaign to reach out beyond my comfort zone. I understand that if I win, I will not have 100 percent support from the entire ward but that I will work hard to represent each individual and each community within the ward with equal vigour. I have knocked on thousands of doors thus far and plan to continue reaching out to my neighbours and my constituents in the ward if elected because being a city councillor is a full-time job and must go beyond a 9 to 5, Monday to Friday committment.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":193,"electoral_race_id":48,"created_at":"2014-07-01T02:47:37.903-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-10T15:06:08.256-05:00"},{"id":356,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nThere is a common understanding among parents that the feedback loop between policy decisions and the impact on teachers and students is too long.  As our children grow we also come to learn that we can not go back and start all over again.  Putting a parent on the St. James-Assiniboia school board would be a vote for making sure policy decisions are done right the first time and add an urgency to oversight of the administration.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nI bring an academic, private sector and parenting background to the election.  My graduate studies background gives me knowledge of what is required to prepare students for university.  As a private sector manager i understand the skill set students will need in the workforce and how to prioritize when working with a limited budget.  Finally as a parent with children in elementary, middle and high school, I have first hand knowledge of how all three levels of school are working.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nThe main issue that I would like to stand for is that principals, parents and students are empowered to influence school board policy.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI know that principals and teachers are going to great lengths to make school enjoyable.  As a parent I know that everything good starts from children wanting to be at school.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nOur family has found everything we wanted in the St. James-Assiniboia school division, but I also know of families that have not.

As a person who was raised, lives and works in St. James, it would be a pleasure to be able to use my Accounting and Finance education and work experience to represent my community in City Council.\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nLiving and working in St. James as the Executive Director for the St. James Business Improvement Zone, Trustee for the St. James-Assiniboia School Division and past Executive Director for the St. James Assiniboia 55+ Centre has been very beneficial in helping me learn more about the residents and our issues.  My previous positions of business leadership as Past Chair for Junior Achievement Manitoba, Past President of Woodhaven Community Club and past publisher and GM of Canstar Community Newspapers has assisted me in working and building relationships with the businesses and organizations that are a part of this area.  I believe my combination of business education and over 25+ years of business experience will serve me well in representing our ward in City Council.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nIn speaking with residents of the community, they are concerned with the poor condition of a number of our streets and infrastructure.  I would like to stand as a Councillor that gives this important community issue the attention it deserves to begin fixing this situation.  I believe that striking a balance between maintaining and investing in road infrastructure is important.  It will come down to how much can be done of either maintaining or investing and how fast to keep the impact on taxes reasonable.  When fixing any roadway project, it should be analyzed for the potential inclusion of active transportation features.  The City has a plan laid out for Transit friendly development and that should be used to guide infrastructure.  Making the city more pedestrian and cycling friendly will provide good return on investment.  \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nI appreciate how many of my family and friends have chosen to stay in St. James to raise their families and what St. James means to them.

In Manitoba, we have a very rich cultural diversity. We have such great potential to use this ethnicity and combine it with our educational system. Empowering our educators is significantly important if we are to improve quality education. I am a believer in continuous growth through training and education. Character building, good attitude and a healthy sense of responsibility is for me what quality education is all about and I will champion these as a trustee. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI believe that my division especially my ward is one of the most culturally diverse community in the city.

I believe and promote empowerment. My perspective and my opinion ends the moment the people speak. That is what my ward will expect from me.

I am running for the position of School Trustee to advocate for kids and make a positive change in our community through more effective education.\r\n\r\n\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nAs a teacher I have recognition of what is taking place in classrooms and in schools. A recent report by the Council of Ministers of Education indicates that students in Manitoba are scoring last among the provinces in math, science and reading. It is clear that we require change. It is important that the people who are approving budgets and allocating funds to schools and student programming have a background in education and a real understanding of what is taking place in schools and classrooms. I also have executive experience serving as the chairman of a board for a major condominium complex. In the position, I have gained experience working alongside others to enact positive change within a community. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nMy vision for our education system is that every child receives the opportunity to become successful and gain the education and skills required to become contributing members of society. This vision requires a system that better addresses the unique needs of students at a base level. Educational inequality is prevalent in our system for a myriad of reasons and I intend to advocate for a system that is more equitable and that meets the needs of every student. I truly believe that education is the foundation of our society. Through more effective education we can proactively address many issues that negatively impact our society today.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nEvery school catchment in the Winnipeg School Division has a unique and socioeconomically diverse student body. Children and families from different backgrounds and ethnicities come together to makeup the educational community. This leads to a greater level of empathy and understanding of different peoples and their unique circumstances. The division itself is very representative of a multicultural society which leads to greater of acceptance of difference. \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nIt is important that we recognize as a community the need for change in our education system. It is clear that kids are falling through the cracks. Maintaining the status quo is not an acceptable approach.

The residents in our city no longer trust the current councillors and administration to look after our city.

Roads, transparency, communication, snow clearing, and brown water.  We have to get a plan for fixing our roads and stick to it.  Transparency is vitally important as it should lead to accountability.  Communication is important because the residents in my Ward would like to be kept informed and have a say in what happens at City Hall.  Snow clearing has to improve as side walks and  back lanes in some areas were cleaned poorly or infrequently.  Brown water is an issue for some in our Ward and I would like to find a solution.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nI appreciate all the parks that we have in our Ward.

I use my past experience to get results for the people of Point Douglas.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI have been raising awareness of Missing and Murdered Indigenous women for over 20 years through the education of others, which started with co-writing and performing in the play “Those Damn Squaws” with Winnipeg's Red Roots Theatre. My interest in bringing this subject to light came from having one of my own friends go missing 20 years ago. More recently I helped initiate Drag the Red, which has gathered volunteers to actively search for missing peoples in Winnipeg's Red River.  \r\n\r\nAs well, I am focused on key priorities for the ward: Safer communities, more jobs and opportunities, and fixing our roads.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nPoint Douglas is a very diverse ward, both culturally and economically. This diversity is a key strength of the ward, and I would be honoured to represent that diversity and ensure all voices are represented at city hall.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI see this election as a tremendous opportunity to bring new people into the democratic process.

I also have a great sense of humor. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\n- Fiscal Responsibility. Millions of dollars are spent annually and they must be spent efficiently and effectively.\r\n- High Quality Education. Giving our children the opportunity to maximize their potential is the least we can do for our future. \r\n- Increase Physical and Health Education. More and more children are playing sports on Xbox/Playstation and less are playing outdoors.

Changing demographics has led to increasing differences in student backgrounds, abilities, needs and desires, creating a more diverse student population than ever before. The result of these changes means that our Division must continue to explore new and innovative approaches to programming and services for its students. \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nWhile serving as a School Trustee for the last eight years, I have come to understand that our School Division has high expectations: for student achievement based on their individual abilities, for employees to continue to grow and develop, and for our school programs  and services to ensure that these are innovative and increase the potential of our students.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI ask for your consideration as I seek re-election as your Trustee. It has been my privilege to represent the Kirkfield-St. Charles Ward. I am committed to work with educational partners in the community to provide an environment that will enable students to be active and successful learners. \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":true,"is_winner":false,"person_id":55,"electoral_race_id":61,"created_at":"2014-09-13T01:52:34.245-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-15T23:38:22.517-05:00"},{"id":184,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\n\nI decided to run for Mayor because it was an opportunity to address some very important issues that would not be addressed by any other candidate: the fact that we live in a divided city. \r\n\r\nThis election offers all of us to come together as citizens and address some of the big issues facing our city. 20 years from now, our children shouldn't be facing the same problems, whether it's with infrastructure, the environment, or social issues.  \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Mayor?\n\nI spent 18 years in the military, and retired in 2011 as a Petty Officer 2nd Class (the Army equivalent of Sergeant). I was stationed in the 5th Ambulance at Valcartier, Quebec, and I oversaw 600 people, including platoon commanders, and was responsible for some of the base infrastructure. I saw what leadership was about, why having a plan matters, and how you motivate people to do their best by appealing to the common cause. \n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Mayor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nThere have been three audits and there is an ongoing RCMP investigation into what's happened at City Hall, and people have lost trust. We need a Mayor who is focused on the public interest, not just the interests of their donors or supporters. I have shown transparency in my election campaign, posting the names and amounts of all my donors. The goal is to put citizens first, while still being fair to everyone else. \r\nThe other is that we need a long-term plan for the city, and we need to follow it. Instead, we have planning based on a crisis model, and it shows in our infrastructure. We need innovation, good ideas, and to put the resources into those ideas.  \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the City of Winnipeg?\n\nThe people really are friendly. My wife is from Quebec City, and when we moved here her family didn't know what to expect, but it has been a great experience. There is a great arts and music scene, a mix of people of all cultures, and it is still a bit gritty. \n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI think this is a very important election. It gives the people of Winnipeg a real choice to set our city on a new and better path. I realize that if elected, I will be the first Aboriginal Mayor of Winnipeg, and for many people in the Aboriginal community, that is very significant. But I know, and the Aboriginal community knows, that we can't do it alone. I grew up in poverty, but now I live in the suburbs with my wife and five children. I want to be a Mayor for everyone.  \n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":184,"electoral_race_id":2,"created_at":"2014-06-06T12:57:39.044-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-16T20:19:01.060-05:00"},{"id":291,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nEducation is the foundation of a civil, healthy society.\r\nFour years ago, I was honoured to be elected. Some of the reasons that I ran included;\r\nbuilding more schools and providing more more daycare spaces (funded by the province),\r\nlowering our taxes and increasing our high school graduation rates. \r\nWe have achieved most of these oblectives!\r\nI like to build on these achievements and add several other objectives including; the most active/healthy and the brightest students in Seven Oaks School Division.   \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nChairman of the Seven Oaks School Policy Committee.\r\nChairmam of the School Division Labour Negotiation Committee for Local 479\r\nFifteen years of experience as a youth employment trainer with the Province of Manitoba.\r\nLong-time member with the Manitoba Round Table for Sustainable Development, the Winipeg Arts Council  and several community\r\norganizations.\r\nVolunteer of the year - Recreation Sports. \r\nGraduate of The Institute of Corporate Directors \u0026 Governance\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nLowering our education taxes\r\nOpening all our school gyms longer hours after school, that students and community members can have more recreation sports and activities\r\nat no cost.\r\nProviding more daycare spaces for our fast growing community.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nThe Seven Oaks School Division/Board of Trustee and the staff find ways to meet the needs of every student that that\r\nattends our schools.

Things such as $40,000 raise in their ward allowance, wanting to give certain condo purchasers $10,000, wasting $150,000 to rent falcons to harass seagulls at the Brady Landfill,  wanting to spend $30 million on one dog park and giving the outgoing mayor and councillors a severance package.  These things are absolutely unwarranted and ridiculous and show a complete lack of respect for the taxpayers of this city.  In the scheme of things, these may be small but they all add up and this money could have been put to better use.  We deserve much better than what we are getting!\n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Councillor?\n\nAs a teacher for 30 years, I have worked with over 5 thousand students as well as fellow teachers, administrators and parents.  In many ways, councillors and the mayor show a lack of direction and wisdom needed to run the city properly. I am confident that my teaching experience would help in this regard.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Councillor, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nIt seems that the past administration is determined to keep Winnipeg in the past.  Our infrastructure is in no better shape then it was 50 years ago.  Look at the \"Disraeli Freeway\" as an example--why is there a traffic light on this freeway as soon as you turn off Main St. to go to East Kildonan?  Why are both spans 2 lanes wide when they should have been 3 lanes  to accommodate present traffic, never mind future needs such as possibly rapid transit?  \n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the ward you wish to represent?\n\nAlthough  St. Boniface is basically the French Quarter of Winnipeg, it is great to see that there is also a large variety of ethnicities not only in the population but also in businesses.  This not only makes this ward interesting but strong.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI have already been contacted by numerous residents with important concerns regarding themselves or the community at large.  If elected, you can bet that I will not be turning my back on these people and will do my upmost to resolve these situations regardless what part of the ward they reside in.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":243,"electoral_race_id":51,"created_at":"2014-09-12T23:11:17.399-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-19T12:52:05.882-05:00"},{"id":355,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 School Board Election?\n\nI decided to run for school trustee because I saw first hand how my father was able to engage in people in our town in constructive way to encourage positive change when he was School Trustee.   I am a young parent who hopes to make this ward better than it already is for children currently enrolled and those that will follow.  Winnipeg in my home; it is where I was born and where I am now raising my family.  I am motivated to work for my community – to engage, to listen, to share, to bring about positive change for our families.  \n\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as School Trustee?\n\nAttending Fort Richmond Collegiate, attaining my degrees at the local University of Manitoba, and eventually becoming a teacher, makes me a homegrown candidate for School Trustee.  As a teacher, I consistently deal with the students, parents, educators and administrators, which gives me firsthand experience to be a School Trustee.\n\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as School Trustee, and why are these issues important to you?\n\nI believe the most important issue is the overcrowding of classrooms. This poses a challenge because we are not able to give adequate attention to the individual needs of students. Teachers become overtaxed in many areas: there are not enough resources, the diverse background of students in abilities and culture, marking load, physical space in the class, and the list can go on. The connection between student and teacher is compromised when there are too many people in a classroom.\n\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the school ward or school division you wish to represent?\n\nI appreciate the diverse cultures that Pembina Trails Ward 3 is comprised of.  Attending Fort Richmond Collegiate, I experienced this first hand.  Parents and communities all express their happiness living in an area that celebrates Canada’s diversity.  This enriches a child’s experiences as they attend schools in the division.\n\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\n\nI am grateful for the opportunity to stand as a school trustee candidate for Pembina Trails Ward 3.\n\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":293,"electoral_race_id":59,"created_at":"2014-09-16T23:28:37.059-05:00","updated_at":"2014-10-19T23:00:02.148-05:00"},{"id":8,"questionnaire":"### Why did you decide to run in the 2014 Winnipeg Civic Election?\r\n\r\nI entered because I have brand new, and unique ideas for the City of Winnipeg.  I want to give these ideas to the citizens and a gift so that Winnipeg can move forward into the modern world.\r\n\r\n### What experience will you bring to compliment your role as Mayor?\r\n\r\nThe role of the mayor is an administrative role.  I have 30 years of experience in business administration.  No other candidate has that qualification.  \r\n\r\n### What are some issues that you would like to stand for in your role as Mayor, and why are these issues important to you?\r\n\r\nAs the public is aware, the main item on my campaign is \" To fix the roads \".  Why is this so important ?  We are the laughed at by the whole country when it comes to our roads.  They have been looked and studied, talked about for years, but to no avail.  They have  been ignored to a point of being dangerous. I plan to attack this issue with a vengeance as mayor.  The absolute first thing that I will do as mayor is to arrange funding for this massive undertaking.  I am the man for this job.\r\n\r\n### What is one thing in particular that you appreciate about the City of Winnipeg?\r\n\r\nWhat I appreciate about Winnipeg is the preservation of our culture diversity.  We do not act as a melting pot. The nationalities that exist in this city have the complete chance of keeping their language and their culture. They are actually encouraged to keep them.  Folklorama is the Christmas of culture display.\r\n\r\n### Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?\r\n\r\nKeep on checking my You Tube channel.  For those who do not know, I filmed this summer 20 small films for my campaign.  I incorporated a little lip singing, a little dance, a little comedy to lighten things up but these videos do display what I stand for.  Enjoy the show.\r\n\r\n","end_date":null,"is_incumbent":false,"is_winner":false,"person_id":9,"electoral_race_id":2,"created_at":"2014-05-28T23:27:51.366-05:00","updated_at":"2016-01-09T08:56:41.224-06:00"}]
